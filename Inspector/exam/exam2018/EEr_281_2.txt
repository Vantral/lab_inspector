According to the common opinion, family can influence children much more than people outside the home. However, the opposite opinion exists at the same time time. 
I personally agree with thought that people otside the home play more important role in any child's life. We study at school, visit cources and univercities, study and work in different places and always meet many people with different views and understandings of this life. Of cource, till the child starts going to school parents influence in his or her life at all aspects. However, starting from visiting school childrens' socialisation process is mostly influenced by pupils (classmates) and teachers at school. For example, our the first teacher shows children many new things that they have never seen before and children, of cource, ask their teachers a lot of questions. Sometimes teachers tecommend pupils to think by themselves and imagine their own views. When a child here so many different types of understanding, it changes his or her mind. 
Not only views of people from society influence childrens' lifes. All children are different and they try to build small subgroups. Every child searchs for his or her own with the similar interests and not all of them will influence in a good way. And such experience is important in our lifes too. For example, Rodion Raskolnikov (the main character of the novel "Crime and Punishment" written by Dostoevsky was strongly influenced in his childhood by seeing the killing of the horse near. Later Rodion will remember this moments of his life in the dream. It is one of his life's key moments. This experience changed all his adult life. Such experience can be got only otside the family. 
From these illustrations it can be clearly seen that not only family has the huge influence in any child's life but there are many other more important (or essential) outside factors which ifluence the child's development.

On the chart we can see that in all the countries presented the overall difference in income between men and women has decreased from 1980 to 1995. More specifically, almost every half a decade in every country the difference in income is smaller than it had been five years ago, with the exceptions of Japan in 1985 and Germany in 1995. 
Through the years Germany and New Zealand had the lowest income difference on average, including the lowest difference in the whole chart from Germany that happened to be only ten percent. Compare that to Japan that had the highest difference of income every five years with the record being around 41-42 percent in 1985. 
It seems that the single biggest decrease of income difference has occurred during the first half of the eighties in USA. The difference in earnings has dropped from almost 40 percent in 1980 to 30 percent in 1985.

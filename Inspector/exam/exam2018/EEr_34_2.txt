It is impossible to help all the people in the world, so governments should focus only on helping people in their own countries. 
Without any doubt, we now all live in one globalized world, which is full of industrial and rich countries. However, some our heighbours may suffer from wars or natural disusters. When such appaling situations happen, people often need help from other countries. But currently this issue is rather controversial, some people believe, that we have to help neighbours when they need it, others suppose, that it is better so tackle your own internal problems. This essay agrees,that governments and people should always try to save people in danger. 
As we live on one planet, the wars or other catostrophies may have a harmful effect on your own country. For instance, we have one atmosphere and when something influences it negotively on the one side of the planet, it may futher be feasible on the another side of it. This connection of various sphears means, that our efforts should be focused on the part of the Earth, where such appalinh situations happen, despite the fact we don't live here. 
But when we put practical thinking away, we start pondering the moral aspect of the issue. It is better always to eslimate the situation and to try to decide who suffers more and who needs the help firstly. For example, femine in African countries is in increasing rates and the great number of people die daily. In comparisson with trafic problems in Moscow this situation triggers much more tragic consecuences. In that case we should firstly pay attantion to this solution. 
To conclude, I find it necessary to say, that being human beings we should regard others as equal to us people and try to support them if it is possible. The government should not deal only with its own counrty but also do global actions.

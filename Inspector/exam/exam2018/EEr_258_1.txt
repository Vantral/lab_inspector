This line graph illustrates the amount of energy produced from fossil fuels in five countries. Overall, the lines of the graph flactuate on the whole scale. Vertically, we can see the amount of energy in percentage. Horizontally, there are years. 
At the beginning, India was on the lowest point on the graph in 1970 and then the situation has changed and India reached 75% concerning the amount of energy produced in 2015 and the same trend we can see in China The situation is different with the United States. At first, the amount of energy in US was quite high and about 95%. Then we can see a slight fall and by 2015 the the amount of energy dropped approximately by 10% and reached 85% on a graph. Also, we can see a significant downturn trend in Sweden. In 1970 the amount of energy produced by fossil fuels was about 83% and then it starts to fall significantly in 1978, the line flactuates on the whole scale and by 2015 it reaches its low point of approximately 10%. The situation is the same with France. 
To sum up, the amount of energy produced from fossil fuels varies significantly in all the countries. Europen countries and the United States have a drop in the amount of energy produced, whereas India and China have a rise on the scale of 45 years.

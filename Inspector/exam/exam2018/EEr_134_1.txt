In 2015 India reached more then 70% of energy and the number of China"s energy peaked at more then 90%. 
The percentage of other three contries was rapidly decreased. The number of energy from fossil in Sweden decreased by 80% in 2015. The average in France and in United States decreased too. Energy from fossil fuels in France falls to less then 50% and in United States to 90%. 
In conclusion, we can mention from the graph the parellel rise in India and China, while three other countries have the parellel decrease.

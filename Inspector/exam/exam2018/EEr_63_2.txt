Nowadays there are a lot of crusial and global problems that a lot of people all over the world face with. Some people consider that governments could help not only local people but also people from another countries. Another people have different point of view. Let`s disscus this topic more deeper. 
In my opinion, countries should help each other in order to solve main problems. First of all, it is known that our planet has such important problems as climate change, terrorism and ect. The government of one country cannot deal with this global issues because these problems have a huge impact on all humanity. Moreover, causes of these phenomenon rooted in all our society, not only in one particular country`s one. It is clear that we should try to prevent or solve these problems together. Secondly, there are a lot of international organizations which were created to unite countries and show the importance of work as a team. All countries have different natural resurces that is why governments should have a dialoge to exchange them. Also, many poor countries of the third world cannot increase their economy, level of education and develop medical service without a help of more rich and development countries. 
On the other hand, a lot of people have an opposite point of view. According to them, an incredible number of people needs help and it is impossible to give them what they want. Besides,they belive that aid which one country gives to another is a waste of time and money. For example, when Russia delivered some food and medical stuff to Syria, a lot of citizents said that our government should spend money on needs of our country. 
To sum up, I should say that this is a very controversial topic and many man many minds. Hovewer, I belive that we are all human and it is normal for us to help each other in difficult situations.

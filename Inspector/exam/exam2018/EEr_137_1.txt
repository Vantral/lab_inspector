This graph illustrates how energy from fossil fuels changing in several different territories. 
First of all, i would like to start with comparing the percentage of growing energy from fossil fuels in two countries: China and India. In both countries the percent is used to growing from 1970 to 2015. By every year it is increasing. The results are very summilare. 
Secoundly, two different countries as France and Sweden are faced with dicreasing energy. 
And the last country is United States. The position of this area is pretty stable. Only in 2010 it started to dicrease. But as we can see the hole situation for US is better than from other contries like China and India. 
In conclusion, i would like to say that it does not matter what political life and weather conditions are in the country. It only depends on how people try to care about there country. (151)

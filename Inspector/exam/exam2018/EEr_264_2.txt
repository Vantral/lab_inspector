It is considered that architects must care about the buildings' functionality rather than their appearance. I completely disagree with the statement. From my point of view, every new construction has to match the surroundings and have a sophisticated appearance as it becomes a part of history and cultural heritage, to let alone the fact that the ability to serve the needs must constantly be put into the construction. 
Architecture always represents the period it was built and the prevalent style people accept. Randomly constructed mixture of styles may only worsen the overall look of the city and create dissatisfaction with the place. For instance, when the Effel Tower was built in Paris, people called it ugly and abysmal because of its completely different style. Moreover, the cities' atmosphere influences even people's mental health, that is why architects should carefully analyse the impact that their work of art may have. 
Safety is the most important criterion that every model-maker has to mind. There must be no miscountings or flaws, as it can inflict damage to thousands of people. That is why i would say that serving special purposes is an underlying feature when building a new city's item. At the same time, architects should not neglect the idea and comfort. For example, in Singapoure there are more and more environmentally friendly skyscrapers, all covered with greenery, that not only suits the atmosphere, but also serves the needs. In addition, beautifully built cities attract tourists from all over the world. 
To conclude, people are concerned with the convenience and their everyday impressions, so the architects' work is both about technical part and creativity. The last one influences citizens' mentality, and more globally, our cultural heritage.

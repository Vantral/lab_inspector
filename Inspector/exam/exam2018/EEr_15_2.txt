It become appartent in recent years that the better life is an issue that many people feeel strongly about. Nowadays there are a lot of problems in the mordern life, and some people believe that it is too difficult to help every person on the earth and the power should focus helping its own people. I totally disagree with this statement. In this essay I will discuse this question. 
Firstly,In the Mordern world Every day we listen the word "globalization". Globalization is the process of conecting countries together in economical, social, enviromental questions and issues. I hope that today every person understant that the world is changing. Now people start to understand that we all live on the one planet and we all the same. Counties and the goverment start to work together and create some international organizations to make this conection better. Today, we can find a lot of international organization conecting with nature protection. This means that the power and people understant that it does not nessecary in what part of the Earth you live, it is important that our Earth is the one, and the mankind has not got another one. 
Moreover, we should remember that we are all people. If you feel good or okay it is not right to close your eays how anothers people suffering from cold, hungry of thirsty. I belive that every one should remember that nobody know what will be tommorow. For example, in Africa hundreds boys, girls, females and men are suffering from the water problem. They just have not got a glass of water to drink. We all live on the same planet and who know, may be, we will have this problem after 10 years too. 
To sum it up, may be, it is not possible to help all the people in the Earth, but I belive that in the process of the globalization the government must try to do it, because nobody know that problem can wait us tommorrow.

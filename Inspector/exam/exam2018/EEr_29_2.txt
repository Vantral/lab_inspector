There is no doubt that we live in a very complex times. A lot of people suffer poverty, hunger, war, etc. That is clear that any compassionate person would like to do his best to help those people, and in terms of global relationships governments of richer and more succesful countries try to do so. But there is an opinion that instead of helping every country that is in need the government should do their best to help people of their own one. 
Firstly, there are indeed lots of poor countries in the world, so if some rich country wants to help them, they should probably cooperate with other succesful and intrested ones, in order to succeed and not loose all of the money that their citizens trust them with. In case there is no other country that wants to cooperate with that government, it should hold a referendum among its citizens and ask them if they approve that help. 
Secondly, there is a great possibility for a country to lose more than it profits from helping other country. There were a lot of examples in history when one country in some way helped another and as a result lost their good relationships with the third one, which was more profitable to be friends with. 
Having all the things consider, I am inclined to believe that for any government serving to its people must be the top priority and helping other countries in need is only appropriate after they are sure that people of their own country are not suffering.

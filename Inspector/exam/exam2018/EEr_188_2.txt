It goes without saying that nowadays the number of people choosing job instead of having more free time is sighificant. However, there is also a lot of people who prefer spare time to low income. In this essay I will shed light on both of the given opinions and will provide my own view. 
On the one hand, there exists considerable number of upsides of neglecting the work and gainings. Due to such a decision, a person can spend more time with his or her relatives and friends, which are thought be the most prominent part of our lives. Moreover, it is much more beneficial for the human's health to work less, as relaxation leads to better quality of sleep, fewer amount of stress-related diseases and, in some cases, more active lifestyle, etc. For instanse, an average office worker consumes a lot of cofee and fast food, sits the most part of the day and has problems with sleep. 
On the other hand, high level of earnings may be the phenomenon incredibly affecting one's lifestyle. Money offers opportunities for high-quality medical services, tourism, self-development, unconstrained consumerism, brilliant education and so on. This is why so many people work hard for their whole lives. Another source of motivation for workaholics is providing their children with decent life conditions. For example, if you spend the major part of your daily routine on leisure activities, you and your children are unlikely to wear fashionable clothes, have expensive hobbies or eat exqiusite food. 
Taking everything into consideration, being rich does not imply being healthy, calm and happy. At the same time, being jobless means be unable to have a high life standart. Nevertheless, I prefer being free more than being wealthy as the most precious things in live cannot be bought.

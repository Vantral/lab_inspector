The graph provides information on the difference between men's and women's salaries in countries from all around the world during a certain period in the end of the last century. 
The most significant feature is the tendency of decreasing the percentage difference. In all the countries earnings of men and women are getting closer to equality. 
The highest difference among the given countries takes place in Japan through all the period. The percentage there starts at 40, peaks around 1985 reaching about 41-42% and decreases by the end of the period stopping at 30. The second highest score in the beginning of the comparison is showed by the USA but through the time it falls drastically becoming the third by 1995 and equaling 20, which is almost twice less than 15 years before. 
The smallest difference is shown in New Zealand changing from 20 to about 11. Another relatively small score is provided by Germany. In the middle of the period Germany even reached the lowest difference among all the given countries scoring 10, whereas the latest leader had percentage about 13-14. However, the difference had slightly increased by 1995 again. 
As we can see, the overall tendency is the decrease of income difference. Even though some countries like Japan or UK have a relatively big percentage, one day it will probably reach 0 and get to salaries equality.

The USA's datas have a wide amplitude: from practically 40% to 20% in the end of exploring period. So this is about 20% difference. 
On the contrast, the minimum amplitude has New Zeland: less than 10%, but this country also had the lowest number in 1980. 
The lowest difference was reached in 1990 in Germany, it was 10% only. Fortunately, it raised just for 1-3% later.

It is a common opinion that architects do not have to be concerned about the appearance of their buildings as it is more important that their works can serve their purpose. It is hard to agree with this opinion and this essay will argue that it is crucial to create beautiful buildings. 
It should be taken into account that the environment we live in has a huge influence on our way of thinking. The recent British research has shown that people who grew up in cities full of buildings with marvelous exterriors are by 35% more creative that those who lived among usual boring houses. As we can see, the appearance of the buildings which surround us affects our ability to generate new great ideas as it every day shows us an opportunity to express yourself. 
Moreover, beautiful environment can make our life much brighter and even a bit easier, which affects our relations with other people. In 2015 an American sociologist made a Fecebook research on the attitude towards the heighbours depending on the external appearance of the buildings surrounding them. It showed that 73% of respondents living among old and simple "blocks" were rude to their neighbours almost every time those addressed them, while the people who lived in cities with marvelous buildings argued with their neighbours only once or twice a month. We can note that a person living in a pleasant environment is less stressed. 
Overall, the exterrior is an extremely important part of a building and architects should pay a lot of attention to it as it influences our way of living and thinking.

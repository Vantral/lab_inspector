It is commonly known that parents and relatives have great impact on the life of children. However, not everyone shares this opinion; for example, some persons are sure that child get an essential experience outside the home. Personally, I suppose that family plays a vital role in child's developpment. 
First of all, relatives are usually the first persons that children see. When a child explores the world he or she tries to repeat the actions and reactions of their parents. In other words, children copy behaviour of their close relatives. In its turn, patterns of behaviour that the person get in the childhood reflect on their further life. For example, if the mother or the father is annoyed at the public transport it is likely that their child will be nervous at the same situations. Besides, almost all human's habits come from the family life. It may influence even food habits such as eating healthy or unhealthy food. 
Nevertheless, the situations which children force outside the home also change child's life and may have effect on his or her identity. For instance, there are many schools that conduct a lot of events dedicated to the environment's protection and involve pupils in these activities. Supporting green movements, children may get a habit to take care of nature without reminders of their teachers. In addition, it is also possible that schools supporting healthy lifestyle may make pupils follow it. 
To sum up, I would like to say that both families and other places which children visit have a huge influence on them. However, I tend to consider that the family creates the basement of person's identity and it is more important than external factors.

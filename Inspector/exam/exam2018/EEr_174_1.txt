The charts below represent the number of students attending different types of courses and proportions of age groups among them. 
As we can see, all types of courses are attended by nearly equal numbers of students, which are 600 to 650. However, science courses are still the most popular, while arts classes are the least attractive ones for students. 
We can also notice that age proportions of different types of courses are considerably different. While the youngest group, which is eighteen to twenty-five years old, contains the majority of science courses attendants, with a 55% result, it is the smallest age group at sports and health courses - 15% of students are teenagers and people in early twenties. That type of courses is the most attractive for middle age group, while art courses are the least attractive for them. People aged over forty are mostly interested in art. 
Overall, all types of courses are popular among students, but the spheres of interest of different age groups alter dramatically.

The graph below illustrates the information about the precentage of energy from fossil fuels in five different countries from 1970 to 2015. 
First of all, China has one the highest statistic of energy. It always becomes bigger and nowadays it is nearly 88 per cent. China line starts from 60 per cent in 1970. 
Second country is India. This country has some similuaraties with China as both lines grow during all the time. So, Indian percentage is quiet less then Chineese. The low of energy from fossil fuels starts from 35 per cent and countinue to grow. Now it has become nearly 72 per cent. 
Also there are some countries with a small statistic of energy from fossil fuels. For example, in the United States there are not many changes. The line falls, but percentage does not change so much. Firstly, it has 100 per cent and then the line lows to 85 per cent. 
The statistic in France is changable too. It was so high, about 90 per cent, but now it has fallen to the 45 per cent. 
The last country is Sweden. Now Sweden has only about 5 per cent, but in 1970 it was high nearly 81 per cent. During these ages the statistic of this country is very changable. From 1980 to 1990 it falled and then in the year 1990 it has become stabaled. 
To sum up the statustics of these five countries, I would like to add that during 45 years all of the countries have had some changes except the United States. This country has stabaled percentage.

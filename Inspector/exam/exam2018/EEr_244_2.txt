There is an opinion that buildings should serve their puprpose insted of being works of art. I absolutely agree with this opinion. 
To start with, it is important to say that architects always construct buildings which will be used by people every day. That is why such constructions should be more protective than beautiful, because people have to be sure that their houses will not fall down. Moreover, if biuldings are constructed for special purpouses, architects have to built them more carefuly and provide them with all the conditions which will be necessary to have there in future. For instance, if the building is constructed for educational purposes, it should be safe and convinience for people who will study there. 
By the way, sometimes there are special areas where all the buildings should look the same. That is why a lot of architects create special design projects which help them to built modern and comfortable buildings, because people often want to live in a place with special appearence like big windows. However, in such situations architects pay much more attention to the design of these buildings, but forget to check whether these constructions are strong or not. In addition, Sometimes architects are asked to built beautiful buildings and if they refuse to do this project, they can loose their job. 
To conclude, I would like to say that it is more important to construct buldings by tacking into account their special purpouse, because it is much better to built strong constructions than beautiful ones.

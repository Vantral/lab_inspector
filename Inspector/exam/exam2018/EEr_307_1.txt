The presented graph gives data on the percentage difference in amount of money females and males were getting for their work between 1980 and 1995. The graph provides informatiom on situations in five countries. There are different lines to show the percentage in each country. 
It can be seen from the graph that that the general tendancy is the decrease in the difference in income between males and females. Is is common for Japan, UK, USA and New Zealand. The parcentage in those countrieas has fallen for about 10 %. However, there is another situation in Germany. Anlike the other countries, the percentage of difference in income had been decreasing till 1990 and then slightly increased in 1995 in Germany. Still, the difference is not rapidly big. In 1995 Germany and New Zealand had almost the same position in the graph. That means, in those countries man and women were close to have the same salary, but still had a difference in about 10 %. 
It can be predicted that the statistics will show the decrease in differences in money males and females get as an income each decade.

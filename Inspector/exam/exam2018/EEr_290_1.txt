This graph illustrates the percentage difference in income between women and men in five countries. It is clearly seen that the pay gap decreased proufoundly since the 1980s in such countries as the USA and Germany. 
The lowest percentage difference was reached in New Zealand in 1995: men's salary was 12 percent bigger than women's. In Japan, however, the gap between female and male workers is wider - 30 percent. The stable raise of equal pay, resembling the one of New Zealand's, can be noticed in the UK. Nevertheless, British men still gain on 24 percent more than British women. 
In conclusion, each country has reached its own level of equal pay by 1995. The most benefitial time for women was in 1990 in Germany, but it lasted only for several years. Great decline in the percentage difference that happened in the USA and Germany gives us hope that conservative countries like Japan will eliminate the pay gap between women and men.

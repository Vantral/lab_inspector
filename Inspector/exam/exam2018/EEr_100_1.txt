The graph shows us the percentage difference in income between men and women in five different countires. Comparing 1980 to 1995, this percentage has significally decreased in all countries; however, some things remain the same. In 1980, the highest difference in income between men and women, which was 40%, has been found in Japan. In 1995 Japan still holded it's position, also the difference made only 30% then. The lowest percent difference has been found in New Zeland both in 1980 and 1995. It is interesting that the highest and the lowest percentage of all the time is also found in Japan (over 40% in 1985) and New Zeland (10% in 1990). We can find the most significant decrease in USA, where percentage fall dramatically from almost 40% in 1980 to 30% in 1985 and finally to 20% in 1995.

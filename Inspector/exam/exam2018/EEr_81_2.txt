Family is one of the most long-standing and essential parts of our society, and it is a common knowledge that parents and the atmosphere in which a clild is nurtured are two main factors in developing and even wellbeing of children. 
I strongly believe that this is more vital in process socialization that society. 
First and foremost, first features and attitude toward people appear in the childhood when a toddler has a capability only to go and say some words. 
In this period family have the strongest effect on a child. 
Secondly, only family has an opportunity to grow children who will be able to behave correctly in our immensely rough society. 
If a person is born in a pleasent atmosphere, he or she will not have problems with peers. 
Moreover, they will know how to stand up for his or her ideals. 
Furthermore, parents learn them the most prominant norms and standarts, which evryone should follow. 
Later children will use them in the society. 
Without this knowledge person cannot live and conform the society. 
Nevertheless, there are some people who claim that society has the strongest influense on clildren. 
For example, nowadays the youth prefer to communicate more with friends and classmates than with family. 
This is main reason why parents cannot make their children to listen to them. 
Secondly, despite the fact that people under 18 are dependend on parents, they do not respect a family because of mass media and popular films where children rebel and want to be free. 
To sum everything up, I am convienced that kids nurtured in happy and kind atmospere with shrewd and kind relatives will pave the way for futher generations and give them opportunity to create new society that will not be such appaling as our, because only in family it is feasible to nurture the best members of society.

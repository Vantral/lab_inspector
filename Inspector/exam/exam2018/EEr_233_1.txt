This tables perfectly illustrate the picture of men and women employment in the regions of Indonesia and Australia in the sectors of agriculture, industry and services in 2010. 
Overall, according to both tables in two areas, it is worth noticing that the majority of men and women are employed in the sector of services, while the sector of industry stays not quite attractive to women workers, especially in Australia. 
To be more precise, it is worth noticing that the percentage(56%) of male workers of services sector in Indonesia is nearly the same as the percentage of female ones (49%), the difference is minor, not more than 10 percent. While the same sector in Australia shows the tendency of women to be employed in services sector(88%), according to the percenatage it is higher 23% than male employment(65%) in 2010. 
Moreover, it is essential to notice that sector of agriculture in Australia compared to the same sector in Indonesia illustrates absolutely differt trends. In other words, about 29% of men are employed in Indonesian agriculture sector while there are only 3% male workers in Australian one. The more essential difference is shown among female workers in both areas: approximately 50% of women, 43% to be precise, work in the agricultural sector, while therer is only 1% of those who are employed in there in Australia. 
Industry sector is possibly to say the most unlikely to be employed in in both areas in 2010. Even though, the percentage of male workers in Australia(32%) is surely twice higher than in Indonesia(15%).

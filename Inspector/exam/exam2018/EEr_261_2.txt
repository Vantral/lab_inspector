People tend to create more and more buldings for various purposes and there are many modern buildings which are known as work of art. Some people believe that it is essential for architects to create the building to be both attractive and useful, however, others think that to serve its purpose is the main aim. I do agree with the first position, however, this essay will describe both views. 
First and more importantly, if the building is both pleasant to look at and do its own function, it is far more efficient for people who live or work in it. The scientific research has shown that people are known to be more preferable to the good-looking things and only then to think about its purposes and qualities. If a person works in a modern high-tech building which looks like a giant skyscraper from one of the popular magazines, it is much more exciting for him to return here and have much more desire to work. 
Nevertheless, there is an opposite point of view. People believe that it is not that important what the office, for example, looks like from the outside, it is more essential what it has inside. Architects should create convenient sustainabale buldings which may mix its functions of beeing both an office for work and an eco-friendly zone for not damaging the environment. For instance, there are many offices in China which role is to be not as hazardous and useless for the nature as the other ones which only spoil everything around them. 
To conclude, in my opinion, it is important for the bulding to have both functions of a pleasant-looking and comfortable place, and I wish people could only enjoy the buildings around them.

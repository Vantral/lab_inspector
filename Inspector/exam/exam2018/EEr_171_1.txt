The charts provide the information about the percentage of different age groups at different courses in a college in the United Kingdom. There is information on three branches, these are science courses, arts courses and sports and health courses. The authors of these charts chose next age categories: 18-25 year olds, 26-40 year olds and 40 years old and above. 
First of all, the total number of students is almost the same in every branch, from 600 students attending arts courses to 650 students who chose science courses. However, the dominant age group varies from course to course. Almost two thirds of the students studying one of the sports and health course are between 26 and 40 years old, while the youngest age group takes more than a half places at science courses. The proportion at the arts courses is a little bit more balanced, although even here we can observe that the majority of students is 40 years old and above. 
Another observation is that two course branches, science courses and sports and health courses, are not so popular between some groups. Only 15% of students of the science courses are above 40. The same 15% percent are 18-25 year olds at sports and health courses. 
Some of these tendences I would explain as following: in the age of 40, it is a little bit late to begin with stuying something fundamental, which is required on the science courses. But it is maybe exactly the right time to try something new or to improve and extend one's art skills.

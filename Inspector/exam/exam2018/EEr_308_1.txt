The line graphs demonstrate the difference in income of workers both sexes in Japan, USA, UK, Germany and New Zealand from 1980 to 1995. 
As it can be seen from the graphs, in mostly all the mentioned countries the difference in earnings tends to minimize. Only in Germany in the last five years of the selected period it started to grow. According to the given statistics, the country where the level of difference is the highest is Japan, where it is 40 per cent in 1980 and 30 per cent in 1995 while the country with the lowest difference is New Zealand with its roughly 22.5 per cent in 1980 and around 12.5 per cent in 1995. The gap between the given percentage of Japan and New Zealand is big and accounts for around less than 20 per cent. It is clear that the data shown in the graphs can be positively interpreted because of the dramatical fall of the difference in the period.

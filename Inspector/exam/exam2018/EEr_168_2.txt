One of the most discussed topics in psychology today is the development of child's character. There are two majour opinions in this discussion. The first claims that these are parents who plays the main part in the process of building child's life. The second says that external factors are crucial. 
From one point of view, during the first three of four years children are surrounded by their parents and relatives. From them they depict ethical rules, moral, the rutine patterns etc. Moreover, parents become child's role models in terms of communication and interacting with others. 
The other opinion does not negate the first theory but moves forward saying that not only parets act an important role in a child's development. They consider external facts as ones that can trigger character and behavioral changes. School is the most remarcable instance of an influesnce from outside the home. Children continue to learn the rules of communication, but somewhat more empirically, by playing and talking with other pupils. They also put into a basic hearchy: there are teachers on the top of it, there are friends, there are different social groups with the different status. Thereby, it cannot be argued that the influence from the society plays a former part suring the children's growth. 
In the conclition it may by highlighted that the discussed question is complex and controversial. Many research groups are working in this feald: psycologists, sociologists and even linguists. Notwithstanding, the correct answer has not been found yet.

These days, people have different approaches towards money and time. While some of us work hard and spend all of the hours on making money, others find it more preferable to enjoy leisure activities no matter how much money they earn. From my point of view, people who have less free time as a result of working a lot in order to get more money have more useful opportunities than those who have less money but more free time. 
On the one hand, people who are always busy doing some sorts of work are likely to have high incomes which provide them with a lot of goods and other pleasures. For instance, businessmen are always seen running somewhere and attending various meetings, so it is berely possible to spend time with them. Obviously, all of their hard work is worth those money they earn because eventually they are able to visit various countries and have great holidays. What is more, earning a satisfying salary means an active way of life full of different challenges and tasks on your agenda that always keep you in shape. 
On the other hand, this life is full of a lot of various pleasures that we are able to enjoy and experience. It is obvious that they take time. Even such ordinary activity as going to the cinema requires free time from a customer. That is why people who spend most of their time having fun and using all these opportunities that free time gives us usually have less money. 
In conclusion, I would like to point out that the desire to have a better life and to buy everything needed for it makes people work harder and earn more money. Even the busiest man sooner or later will have spare time.

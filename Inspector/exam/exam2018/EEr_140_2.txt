Our world is full of the cities, some of them are works of art, others have good planning. Cities are growing all the time, villages are becoming bigger and the people's living area is extending. I convinced, that building must serve its purpose, but architects should not forget about the beauty. 
Every person has need of beauty, no one wants to live in the grey world. I think, that the purpuse of architects is to build something creative. Some people can say, that population of the city need certain buildings, that will serve its purpose. Of course, city needs shops, schools and fabrics, but if the architect has a talent, any building will become a masterpiece. 
Also, there are a lot of places in our world that seem very similar. Industrial cities has a very simle architecture and sometimes it is difficult to say the name of the city by the first look. Lots of people will disagree with me, because there are many historical and cultural monuments, that can give identity to the city. The problem is that this monuments look like dimonds among the boxes. 
In conclusion, i'd like to say, that it is not necessaty to build works of art all the time and everywhere, nevertheless architects should pay attention at buildings they create. As for me, architector is a really artistic profession, people who want to do this work must understand their importance and significance for the city. Nobody wants to live in gray cities full of similar boxes, doesn't it?

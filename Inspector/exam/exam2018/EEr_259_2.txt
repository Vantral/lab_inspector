Nowadays some people state that, firstly, a building should be useful and then it can be a piece of art. Others argue with them. Personally I agree with the statement and I am going to prove it futher. 
First of all, everything on the Earth has its purpose, any building is not an exeption. There is no doubt, there may be more than one purpose but nevertheless I am sure that the use of something is the most essential. In another way, I suppose, there would be so much "rubbish" on our planet and even incredible buildings would not be needed. The balance between the first purpose of a building and the importance of its beauty should be found. 
Secondly, not every person is fond of architecture because of different reasons. A lot of people all over the world live their lifes in the most usual way. They have a job which is not in their favour but they should earn enough money to meet all daily needs of their families. Travelling and adoring architecture are traditionally features of some rich persons. For others it is rather more important to educate their child in comfortable schools where pupils can be in safety or to take care of their health in hospitals where they can be sure that nothing bad could happen if any member of their families would have to go there for some time. Such people just have no time to think about appearences of the buildings. 
In coclusion, the first purpose of any building is to be useful for people and after that the architects have an opportunity to do their best. The beauty of buildings is not in priority for everyone whereas its safety of comfortable being there are vital in daily life for each of us.

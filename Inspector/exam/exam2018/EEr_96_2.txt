There is an opinion that it is more important for a building to serve its purpose than to look beautiful, and that architects should not worry about producing buildings that are works of art. 
I personally agree with this opinion to only a certain extent. The best expression of my position on this topic would be to say that I agree with the first part of the statement but strongly disagree with the second one. 
I absolutely support the idea that the main purpose of an architect is to project and build a house that will last for a long time and will be good enough for living. If making a house beautiful or aesthetically pleasing stands in the way of these important factors then it must be obvious for the architect to choose the latter over the former. It is important to note that architecture as a profession is almost unique regarding this issue, because even such things as clothes or furniture are way less essential and expensive. 
However, choosing practical features over aesthetic ones is not usually the case. Most of the times houses can be and are built both practically and as a work of art. 
As an artistic person myself I find the need for artistic expression very important for both the artist and the consumer. More people will want to become architects and build houses if they are promised more artistic freedom. 
To realise how artistic expression benefits the consumer it is important to understand that the conditions you live in can influence your mental health just as much as your physical. For example, there have been a lot of research on colour and how it changes a person's mood. To me it is absolutely clear that living in a well-designed building will influence your mental health in a positive way. 
To conclude I would like to say that the need for practicality not only doesn't stand in the way of artistical expression but rather reinforces it. Limitations are the root of creativity.

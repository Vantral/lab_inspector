The presented chart and table indicate the percentage of overweight girls and boys in Canada from 1985 to 2005 and the percentage of them who did regular exercise in 1990 and 2005. The first remarkable notice is that the data of number of overweight children have risen to 2005 (from 12 and 11 to 22 and 25). Also in this year it is biggest difference between percentages (3%). However the smallest difference we can see between children particulary in 1985 and 2000. Boys had the lowest percentage than girls up to 1995. One of the feaures of the chart is the data of percentage in 1995 which became the same (16% partuculary boys and girls). After that girls' percentage dicrease and start to be lower than boys'. Consider percentage of children who did regular physical activity, there is a sharp rising. Kids of both sexes became to have sport more in 2005 than the childrens of 1990. The difference between girls' data is 26% while boys' is 30%.

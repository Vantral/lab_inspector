The graph given provides us information about male and female workers' earnings between 1980 and 1995 in Japan, Germany, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. 
As it can be seen from the graph, the most significant difference in earnings took place in Japan with the highest number of 40% in 1980, insignificant rise in 1985 and dramatic fall to 35% and 30% in 1990 and 1995 respectively. The situation is different in the USA. Starting with nearly 40% in 1980, just as in Japan, the difference fall to 30% in 1985 and continue to fall after that: to 23% in 1990 and finally to 20% in 1995. In the UK the difference is 37% in 1980, about 34% in 1985, 26% in 1990 and 23% in 1995. The fall is not as dramatic as in the USA. Overall numbers are less significant in Germany: 20% in 1980, fall from 19% in 1985 to 13% in 1990 and to 11% in 1995. In New Zealand numbers fall from 24% in 1980 to 15% in 1985 and to 10% in 1990. In 1995 we can see the rise from 10% to 12% which is the only rise that can be seen through all of the countries during the period. 
All in all, we see an obvious downwards trend in every country except New Zealand in period from 1990 to 1995 and Japan from 1980 to 1985. The biggest number was in 1980 in Japan and the USA, but the fall in percentage was much bigger in the USA. The lowest numbers through the period were in New Zealand and Germany.

There is a prevelant strong belief that it is of primary important for buildings to be optional. People who claim so stress that it is not nesessary to think about beauty making the building. As for me, I cannot quitely agree with this statement. I clain that purpose is significant, but we should not forget about art. 
In my opinion, every building should compare both purpose and beauty. I am sure that it is nesessary to make facilities not only for art. To begin with, according to the article, there was a gap in 2009 in Saint-Petersburg. One architecturer desired to built a little palace in the center of city. The pproblem was that this city lacks to extra place. This proposal was not approve. Secondly, all famous buildings which was created many years ago as the houses for reach people now have transformated into museums, theatres or galleres. In my view it proves that building should serve the purpose. 
On the other hand, every coin has two sides. I believe that a building should be both profitable and beautiful. I would like to stress that every city has its own plan. It means that a building should be the part of city end meet its requers. Beautiful architecture makes city more popular for visiters. To my mind it stimulates financial benefits. Obviously I'm sure it is not hard to make such building. For example, the bank on the Kuznetsky Most street. It looks like old building, which can be considered as a part of our cultural heritage. Indeed it is a modern one. This example illustrates the proper process and idea of building. 
In conclusion I would like to remember a wise proverb: Many men, many minds. Undoubtedly, some people claim that buildings should only serve the purpose, dispite the art. As for me, I partly agree with this statement. However, I would like to stress that every building should be beautiful and tend to be a part of art. It is of great significance, because such buildings shape our city.

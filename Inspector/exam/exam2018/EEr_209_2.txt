Nowadays, in the world under the rule of money, it is almost impossible to imagine a life without the whole time free or not spent on this very work just to earn some, even if there is a smaller opportunity to rest, however, some prefer not to work that hard, so not to earn more ammounts of money, but to have more free time. Personaly, i agree with the second type, as there are certain things i consider to be more essential than money and my free time is one of them. 
Despite my own opinion i may understand why people work so hard to gain money. Firstly, it provides a bigger possibility to rest later, if you earned so much that you can make yourself feel free in future decisions and desires, it would bring a happy time spent while old. Every retired hard working person who was rather successful earlier made his own life much more interesting, as an example, my uncle, who used to play in orchestra now, being old, have more free time for his own desires, because have already earned enough money while having less free time. 
However, this argument usually refers to the individual cases, as people still tend to spend everything they once earned very quickly. Besides, when you work and earn not so much, but have a lot of free time, you have more opportunities to develop yourself and possibly create or fund something basing on these knowledge, which may bring even better results. As an example, Yuriy Dud, a famous russian journalist was working hard, but was not gaining huge ammounts of money, until he gave up on his main job, had some free time and created the most viwed channel with interviwes in the world with almost no money. This brought a result of future success, so the period of free time and no money helped him in future life. 
To conclude, basing on the examples, both of the sides may be considered right, although i prefer the more free time and less money case, as it is more about joy and future prospects, while still having some money.

Some people say that the family is the most powerful influence in any childs life. Other people say that it is influences from outside the home that play a bigger part in a childs development. 
Every single human has been influinced by someone or something during his life. Many people believe that family influinces us a lot. I agree with this point of view, and I would like to share some ideas of my own life and experience. My family has always been a perfect model of how you should and should not act, think and live. My parents` life example has always influenced me. We have lived together for twenty years, so I have seen and heard a lot from them. We have different tastes, but also we have common hobbies, like literature, sports, cooking. They did not tell me what was right and what was wrong, I understood it making my own choices, but also thinking about what would my mother or father do. 
Sometimes people do not have any family, or their parents do not spend enough time with their children. In that case those people learn everything by their own, or get influinced from outside the home. May be this type of education or even selfeducation is not that bad, but still I think that family`s opinion and help matter more, than a stranger`s words. I believe that children should learn not only from their parents, but they can surely trust them more, than an unknown person. I also know many good examples of people, who had never had a family and had been influenced by books and different characters, or people who surround them. 
Finally, I would like to mention, that it all depends on person and his character. I believe, that all that I have got from my family helps me a lot, but still I have some friends who have been influenced by their teachers, friends or favorite writers and those played a bigger part in their development. Also, I know that there are many people, who did not try to find any other people to lead them, people who made theirselves by their own.

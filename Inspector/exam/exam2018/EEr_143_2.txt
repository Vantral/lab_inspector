The purpose of modern Buildings is a very topical problem nowadays. Some people say that the information which an old building can give us is not usefull, and that we should think only about how the Building looks like. Also, the architect's ability is very important. It is known that they should work with buildings that are used as works of art. As for me, the problem is rather complicated and I partly agree with people who think that purpose of building is more important than its look. 
Firstly, it is very important to notice that old buildings can help us to "feel the history". As for my I find visiting ancient places an amasing adventure. We can imagine various famous people who live many centures ago and fight for the castle we visit. 
Secondly, I find restavration one of the major problems nowadays. All buildings that were restaurated we see through his architecture's point of view. Such building is like a dead person. You cannot feel pleased visiting such place. I suppose that only several persons have an architectual talent and can make magik things using it. 
To sum up I would like to tell about my personal experience. In my native town there were a lot of ancient buildings which are the part of history and the part of my heart as well. Five years ago our Government begins a restovrating programme. I find that this fact is terrible because they simply destroy theese buildings and rebuilt them as shopping centers or cinemas. I suppose that making such things they are not only destroy our town and its histiry they desthoy the hope in our hearts because the do not let pupils and children to know more about their history.

In the chart we see the average of boys and girls in percents who had obesity from 1985 to 2005 and in the contrast two genders who did exercises regularly from 1990 to 2005. 
The first chart shows that in 1985 and 1990, 1995 boys and girls didn't have huge problems and difference in that issue. Started from 2000 to 2005 the numbers of people with overweight problems signhificantly raised in that case. 
If we look through the next chart we can see that the average of boys and girls in Canda became more active than they used to be in 1990 (approximately in 20 percents). And boys did more activity than girls more than 20 percent in 1990 and in 25 percent more in 2005. 
So, it is important to say that Canada has raised generations who prefer sport rather than to be overweight.

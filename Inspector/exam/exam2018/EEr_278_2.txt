It is argued that family tends to provide the strongest influence on children. Others believe that there are many factors that form the child's character. This essay will discuss who provides the biggest impact on a child's development and who is in a low to do it. 
First of all, being outside the home a child can find itself under the bad influence. The habbits of street frinds might be taken and it is only the manner of speaking but the general behavior can be changed. Secondly, the adults can provide the examples how to put oneself in a wrong way and the autorities will be mixed. Thirdly, on the streets a child can become a victim of kid-napping and it is obvious to protect him / she from it. 
On the other side, under the sharp look of parents a child is likely not to face with so many challanges. Firstly, a family might control the network of their child and it is easy to keep the control. According to Russo, parents have to know about there children's frinds and to regulate there relationships. Than, a child may not be disturbed from learning. If education is in the high priority, it is viltely important to take care of child's study. Finally, only the worth examples can be provided by parents. 
To conclude, I would like to note that family has the biggest influence in any child's life. It became normal because parents are interested in their children's future. If not, than nothing rests for youngers than to become influenced from outside the home.

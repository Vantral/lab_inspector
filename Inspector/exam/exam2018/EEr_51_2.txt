There is point of view that it is not fesable to provide everyone in the world with help. Some people consider that goverments ought to help their own citizens, while others hold a counter opinion. All things consedered, I believe that people in the country should be the first priority for the goverment in order to maintain peace. 
First of all, helping people in the own country is significant for future life. In other words, people need to be provided with health care system and highly qualified education. Goverments should fund those aspects of social life in order to bring up healthy and intellegent generations, thus, they may develop the country in the future. As an illustarion, the literacy rate in Russia has increased, as a result, the country has taken the higher place in the internstional arena. 
On the other hand, it might seem selfish to not take care of neigbourhood countires. What is meant by this is that provided that the good relationship is established between two countries, it is crusial to support citizens who might be in a critical condition. For example, Russia have been helping Ukranian people suffering form the war, considering bonds and healthy relationship in the past. 
To sum it all up, I am still following the idea of putting own citizens on the first place. Without any doubt it is significant to support other countries on unstable period however, goverments need to nurture their own people in a wealth and appropriate conditions. Otherwise, some great uprisings might appear in the country because people will not be pleased by what do they get from the goverments.

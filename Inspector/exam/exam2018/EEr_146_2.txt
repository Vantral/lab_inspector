It is argued that architects should consider convenient and useful buildings instead of wasting their time on creating too twisted designes. As far as I am concerned, such approach may cause the complete change in the city`s look, and not in a good way. 
Firstly, the view of the building can have a great influence on people`s mood. It means, that huge and terrifying skyscrapers are likely to make a person feel like he or she lives in a concrete joungle. For example, there have been built lots of new blocks of flats after Gorbachev`s architechture improvements in Russia, but they all looked absolutely similar, plain and dull. It is sure to make a person feel under the pressure or even depressed. 
Secondly, the appearance of a building can also have a considerable impact on people`s behaviour and attitude. For instance, if a school looks not up-to-date and requiers serious changes, students might feel not motivated enough to study. In contarst, it is hard not to get inspired in a modern and smart-looking building. Architects should pay more attention to such easy way to increase students` productivity. 
In conclusion, I strongly believe, that the influence of surrounding area on people`s mood and behaviour is hard to overestimate. Despite the fact, that it is sure to involve extra time and money, working on the beautiful architecture is undoubtedly worth doing.

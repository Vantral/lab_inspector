It was precisely 40 percent in 1980, then it slightly increased between 1980 and 1985, and after that it fall to nearly 30 percent between 1985 and 1995. The difference in the USA was slightly under 40 percent in the 1980, but then it fell dramatically, and in 1995 it was just over 20 percent. In the UK the difference was slightly over 35 percent, then it started to fall gradually to just under 35 percent in 1985, and after that it fell down to 25 percent in 1995. 
Talking about Germany, we can see that the difference there was nearly 25 percent in 1980, but then it decreased to only 10 percent in 1990, crossing the New Zealand line between 1980 and 1990, but then it started to rise and in 1995 it ended up higher than the difference in New Zealand, at a point of just under 15 percent. The difference in New Zealand was decreasing steadily from 1980 to 1985, but then it fell dramatically and reached the point of just above 10 percent.

There is a popular opinion that it is family that mostly defines the personality of a child in their first ages. At the same time there are people who believes some external factors to be more significant for a child's development and growth. This essay agrees with the first opinion, although it will outline the discussion of both points of view. 
The main idea of those who believe family to be the most important part of children's lives is that kids spend almost all their time with their relatives. In most cases children live with their parents which means they often share their free time. It seems to be a normal and socially expected situation when caring parents try to dedicate their leisure to education and entertainment of their little ones. Parents also have some forms of control on their kids' school preparation, behaviour, choice of friends and many other aspects of daily life. Even in the lack of attention and care from parents a kid's personality is shaped by principles on which their family is based. Some psychological research prove that people often grow up similar to one of the parents in their temper and habits. 
The opposed point of view is usually built up on the idea of different forms of social diversity being the most influential in any child's growth. The defenders of this opinion argue that there are many examples when a kid from a decent family develops different behaviourial deviations after meeting the real life full of violence and unjustice. 
To conclude, both opinions are possible and may be aupported with valid arguments. However, it seems to me that a man brought up by loving and smart parents will always stay a good person no matter how different the surrounding reality is.

In the 21th century there is a tremendous number of serious problems, including poverty, dangerous diseases, pollution and lack of food, that need to be tackled for the substantial development of the humanity. Some people condider that trying to decide all the problems of the world is futile and that governments should pay attention to the people of their own countries in the first place. However, others think that helping people from other countries is also really crucial. To my mind, in plenty of cases governments have to help citizens of different states. 
To begin with, global problems that require joint effort of all countries of the world are becoming more and more significant. For example, terrorism is spreading all over the world and if countries, that are not influenced by it now, do not help to destroy it in other parts of the world, very soon can also experience terrible terrorists' attacks. Furthermore, illnesses that cannot be cured in the undeveloped countries tend to spread to other states very quickly,and people from these countries suffer because their governments did not dare to help to fight the disease when it was not so wide-spread. Besides, poor countries cannot offer job opportunities and cannot develop their economics without the subsidies of well-developed countries, as a result people leave their home, causing an increase in migrant's flow which has a bad influence on lifes and safety of people from countries where they come to. 
On the other hand, if countries spend too much time trying to help foreigners, the citizens may also suffer because of lack of money which is being spent on other countries' problems. 
All in all, in my opinion, it is obvious that countries should do their best to contribute to the solving of global problems that people face all over the world, but, paying a lot of attention to the world's problems, governments should try to save the balance and not to forget about the problems of their own citizens.

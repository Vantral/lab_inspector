There are different thoughts about building and art like about things which could not be without each other nowadays. Many people believe that it is not necessary to worry about about beautiful looking of buildings. Others think that it is impossible. 
It is unbelievable to imagine our world without the architecture like without an area of art. There are many significant places, where people go to see, to touch, to make photos. Moreoften, these places are different churches and cathedrals, towers and bridges with long history. However, there are many even modern buildings, like Moscow-City. This project is nice and functional. There are many offices, flats, shops, restaurants and may be something else in it. Also there are many styles of architectire. Everybody can fing favorite one. Classic, gothic, modernd and many others. Every of them has its own special factors. These styles were created in different times and in situations by separate people or whole communications. 
On the other hand, there are peole who are against this idea. They are sure that the main goal for architects to make their projects easy for understanding, useful and practice. However, our cities, towns and streets would be same. It is is imagined like huge amount of grey buildings with same shapes, high and looks. In this way, architects are not needed, are not necessary at all. People who are absolutely far from art do not understand it. However, there cannot be too many these people. Most of them understand the importance. 
Thus, of corse, first of all, buildings are for living, working, eating, meeting and communicating and many other different activities. However, it means to delete an important thing in the world - to forget about architecture like about area of art. It must be. Poeple need it. We cannot forger about our world-history, about own histories and culterals.

The question of whether the authorities should help only the native population or pay attention people around the world is one that has been under discussion for some time now. On the one hand, some people think that the government must hepl those, who really need it despite the motherland of the person, while others believe that the state should think about its own society. I agree with the last ones. 
To start with, it is not beneficial for a country to help absolutelly everyone. It will have a negative impact on state's economy. For instance, migrants from various countries might occupy the whole cities and state their own rules in this areas. In that case such economical behavior will lead to various vital disputes in society. 
Secondly, the more attation the government pay to their citizans the better quality of life will be in this country. In such case, the authorities have an apportunity to give more money from the state badget to improve their health care service. 
To sum up, it is important to say that one country simply cannot help everyone in the world, because the number of people on our planet is more than 7000000000. In my opinion, a states should think about people who live in it and makes their lives better.

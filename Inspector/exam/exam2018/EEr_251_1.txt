Data depicted in the chart concerns the energy, produced by the fossil fuels in five countries in the period between 1970 and 2015. 
Three out of five countries experienced a decline in the energy production: the USA, France and Sweden. The sharpest dip took place in Sweden, whereas China and India succeded in increasing their energy resources. 
To look at the chart in more detail, China, with almost 90% of its energy produced by fossil fuels reached the top in 2015. USA, holding a second position, suffered a stable decrease in eneregy manufacturing during the whole period. Whereas the sharpest increase took place in India, escalating it to the third position with around 70 per cent of energy produced by fossil fuels. There had been the most sugnificant decline in fugures of both France and Sweden between 1970es and 1990, their figures were flactuating for the rest of the period, but the main trand was still downgrading. Fossil fuels make up only about a half of energy production in France, and less, than a third in Sweden.

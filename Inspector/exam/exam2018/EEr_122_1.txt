The graph demonstrates the evolution of the wage gap over the course of 15 years. 
The common point between all the countries is that the diffrernce in salaries in 1995 is lower than in 1980. In 1980, New Zealand showed the lowest figures, the difference equalling to 20%. Japan, on the contrary, had the highest wage gap of 40%, the US being a close second with about 39%. As the years passed, however, the situation changed. Since 1990 all the countries have been experiencing a steady fall in numbers, with the exception of Germany. As of 1995, the highest figures still belonged to Japan, having decreased by 10%. The last place was equally kept by New Zealand, with numbers close to 10%. However, Germany had been showing lower results than New Zealand for more than a decade and its numbers are second lowest (around 13%). UK ended up higher on the list than the US, with a result of 24% as opposed to 20 in the States. 
Overall, the situation around the world seems to have significantly improved.

Nowadays, in modern world we are surrounded by buildings. A lot of people say that buildings should be beneficial in usage, rather than be pleasant to the eye. But I think that architecture should have a cultural meaning also and I would like to explain why in my essay. 
First and foremost, architecture is something what can bring joy to us. Many people all over the world like to spend their free time walking around the city and enjoy the beautiful landscapes of the buildings. For example, there are some tours in European cities which offer excursions to see beatiful or unusual constructions. Secondly, some buildings carry a function of historical monuments. Even in Moscow can be seen a plenty of buildings of previous times and they have a specific atmosphere. A lot of people say that visisting historical buildings gives a connection with previous generations. This feeling is unforgettable and brings you many positive emotions. 
However, some people say that building should only serve its purpose and be useful for the public. In modern world exist too many buldings that some of them should be demolished as they take too much space and no one lives there. Our planet is overpopulated and people need more space for living. But i do not agree with them. 
To sum up, I strongly believe that buildings should look beutiful and governments should preserve historical or unusual constructions, as they are an integral part of our culture. People need something to enjoy in their daily life. Beautiful and extraordinary constructions make a good impression on us, so we should encourage architects to construct buildings which will look beautiful and will make our city nice.

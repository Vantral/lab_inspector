Nowadays some people believe that the design of building is not so important as its functions. Others claim that architects can create some buildings that are works of art without any troubles. Personally, I agree with all the given opinions, because sometimes the appearence does not even metter, when the building serves its purpose, and also architects should make beautiful buildings, due to the fact that people can't leave without art. 
Talking about the first opinion it is essential to mention, that for building its functions are more important than its appearence. For example, my HSE campus does not look like any modern building, I can't say it is beautiful, but still, here, every day and every time I get knowledge and unforgettable experience. I fell a specific atmosphere in this capmus. Both professors and students dp their work here. The other example, some hospitals in Moscow. They look like old, ugly buildings, but doctors here save a lot of lives and help people to prevent and cure some diseases. 
On the other hand, architects should not worry about creating buildings that are works of art. First of all, people really admire art and such wonderful buildings inspire many ordinary civilians and even tourists. For example, The Moscow City. These scyscrapes is an outstanding feature of Moscow, which looks as modern as United Arab Emirates. Secondly,works of art give a lot of emotions. Personally, I really like the creativity of designers who make some paintings on the building of Atrium shopping mall. Every time I see it I just take a photo, because it insipires me and make me smile. 
To conclude, I' d like to say that despite the fact the appearence of building is not the most important thing, we should let architects to create something new and beautiful, because art really attracts people.

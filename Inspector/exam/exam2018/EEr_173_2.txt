Nowadays, children are depending on various factors. In order to develop, they need to be taught properly. Opinions about the way of getting experience tend to vary. Some people think that the family does the best job of teaching a child, while others claim that the best influences come from outside the home. 
Personally, I think that family can give their child the best development. First of all, they can be very supportive. Parents and siblings can help their child if he or she is having a problem that is impossible to solve without outside help. That will give him experience of how to deal with similar situations. Another advantage of family support is that many children are living with their parents, which means they can always have a talk with their parents about any situation. 
However, some people say that children should be getting more experience from the outside. They support their belief by claiming that if a child depends on his family too much, it will be impossible for him or her to act freely. Children with overprotective parents never undergo any significant development and remain incosistent of doing anything out of their will. 
This may be true, but families are trying to avoid such problems by giving their children only basic knowledge and nothing else. That way children can learn the rest from the outside experience and get a character development without depending on their family too much. 
In conclusion, I still believe that family is a good source of a child development, despite all the boundaries of their influence.

There are two views of different factors which can influence to us in our childhood and both of them might be important. 
In the one side, family is the first powerful influence in the child's life. People who named the family influence to each other every day and it is very important to the small child, because he or she has not another factors of changing and this factors may do not changing for years. So, family is the first but not the last powerful. 
In the other side, the influence from outside can change a lot in child's life. Small man finds friends and haters and they influense to each other. The teachers in school change the child's type of thinking because they make him to do exersices those have only the one or two right answers. Of course, this factor cannot be only positive but the friends and haters, teachers and hobbys make harmony in child's life. All of this factors change the child, make him to grow up. 
To sum up, the first part of our life we spend in family and, of course, it take the big development in child's future. In the second part in our life we contact with a lot of people but the family do not end it's influence. Child grow up and stand a person. So,I do not think that this two powers of influence child's development have differents proportion in our life.

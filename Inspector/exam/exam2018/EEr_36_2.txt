It is imposissible to help all the people in the world, so governments should focus only on helping people in their own countries. 
In the contemporary world there has been much debate about whether countries are capable to intervent in other countries governments in order to improve their peoples' condition or concentrate solely on their on population.

According to modern policy of the majority of governments, countries of the first two groups endevour to help countries of the last. Nevertheless, developed and developing countries are hardly can be considered as epitomes of dreamlands. There are numerous flaws in their economical, political and social policy which is in need to be renovated, renewed and reconsidered.

The reason why the Earth set on to divide in small fractions is due to that it is impossible to control all of the territory and have unite community, thanks to quntative feature of population of our planet. 
Summing up everything mentioned above, the following conclusion can be made: modern governments are in charge to facilitate their peoples' lives first, making this target their priority, and afterwards endevour to help to boost other countries life level.

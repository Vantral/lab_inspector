Many people admire architecture as humanity always tried to make it looks beautiful as it presents a look of a city. Nowadays the society is more pragmathic and some people think that it is better not to spend time and money trying to make buildings a peace of art, but put an afford to make it more comfortable and usefull. According to my point of view, urban landscapes should be made up with the architecture. 
First of all, marvellous views of the city makes place more attractive for tourists what is benefitial for a state. Secondly, the look of the urban place has an impact on citizent attitude to their city. It decreases the problem of imigration and helps government to get more taxes. Moreover, architecture display the level of national cultural development as it is not aimed to be just beautifull but also it keeps history of country or even humanity. 
There are people who prefer to see more practical places with no any decorative elements. Strickt-styled bildings are less expensive. That is a big andventuge for the state budget as there are a lot of other aims that are needed to be financed. Nevertheless, simple-form living bildings make people feels that they are equil and are about the one social and work class. 
There are the good sides in making buildings to serve its purpose only, but in my opinion sometimes it is more important to spend more time and money on something beatiful and meaningfull than spend it on something boring and comfortable one. The buildings that looks the same may make the illusion of people equility but does not change a thing as it is just an first impression that does not solve the problem. 
To sum it up, to my mind architecture is an important part of any city and coutry. It forms sightseeing and peoples feelings toward the places. In my opinion, architecture and more brightes and beautiful worldwide bildings should be seen as nothing but a masterpiece. Architecture was an art in the past and it should be it in the feauture.

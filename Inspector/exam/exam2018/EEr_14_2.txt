In our world a lot of suffering exists. In our native country and among the others. Taking care of such problems, governments can try to solve them. But the question is should we help the other countries with their problems, or should we concentrait on our own? It is a very controvercial topic. And as I believe, there is an opportunity to compromise. 
It is precisely understandable, that the focusing on the problems of our own country can benefits a lot. And, I should say there are a lot of problems to compete with. Firstly, it will uprise the living conditions and improve the international level of our country. Also, this can be a source for extra money, witch we can spend on the improving of science and art. 
On the other hand, there are myriad of countries, which due to some problems cannot help their people on their own. And this is the question of survival of nations. From that side, it is a priceless deal, which also can help us to improve our international level. Moreover, by such act of altruism, we can achieve an eternal gratitude from the saved nations, wich we can use in our own interests. 
Now, you can see, that both path are profitable in their ways. But I believe, that till there are still serious problems in our country, we should focus on them, otherwise, it will be our nation among the beggars.

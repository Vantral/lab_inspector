The tables given illustrate the number of men and women working in three employment sectors in two countries in 2010. 
Overall, the highest number of workers in both countries we can see in sector of services, whereas the least popular sector among female and male workers of Indonesia is industry and agriculture in Australia. 
In the first table it is shown that women work in agriculture rather than in indusrty and services, that is why their number is higher than in the other fields. Males of Indonesia prefer to work in such areas as industry and services, as the table shows. However, the industrial sector involves a really small percentage of total number of workers. 
From the second table it can be seen that a tiny percentage of workers chose agriculture as a place of work. In contrast with women of Indonesia, Australian women prefer to work in sphere of services and the huge percentage of them work there. And surprisingly, it is the most popular employment sector among both men and women. And as it can is seen from the table, that more Indonesia's males work in sector of industry and agriculture.

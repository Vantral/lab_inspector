In the graph we can see the percentage difference in earnings between men and women in five countries between years 1980 and 1995. There are time gaps on horisontal and percent on vertical while each of five lines represent one of five countries: Japan, USA, UK, Germany, and New Zealand. It is very noticable that by 1995 difference in income in all contries is approximatly 10 percent smaller than it was fifteen years before at 1980. However while in Germany it started to grow back in 1990 in all the other countries in continue to decrease. Comparing two different groups of countries where first would be Japan, USA, and UK and sekond would be Germany and New Zealand we can clearly see that first group started with bigger difference of approximatly 40 percent while sekond one started on approximetly 20 percent. With all that said it is obvious that nowadays difference in income between men and women becomes smaller each year nearly everywhere.

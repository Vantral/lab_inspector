Nowadays there are thousands of problems in every country, people struggeling different or common troubles. The best thing that governments can do is to focus on helping people in their own countries and only after solving all those problems - do something to help others, so I partly agree with this statement. 
On the one hand, it is crucial to be open to everyone's problem, be helpful and kind but the problem is that we live in the world where are hundreds of countries with its own government who was chosed by people to rule and to solve the problems in the country."Mother should take care of her own child at first", by this quote we simply can see that problems of government's own country should be placed on the first position. 
On the other hand, some countries have such a huge amount of troubles and such a little amount of resources to solve them that governments of such countries cannot exist without outcoming help from other countries. For example, the situation in Syria,where thousands of innocent people live in the endless war, dying for nothing and not just because they were killed but also because of the hungre. Governments from all of the world are helping Syria to go through this hard time. 
In conclusion, I would like to mention that every problem in every country has someone who would solve it. Nevertheless, our world is still showing some signs of humanity just because we are helping each other, so if the situation in your own country is stable and showing no signs of war, why not try to help others?

It is believed by many people, that buildings should be convinient and fit its requirements rather than please our eyes and its a waste of time for architects to try to create something outstanding and unique. This essay will discuss these opinions and provide some contradictory arguments. 
To start with, it is a basic demand for any building to be safe, long-standing and to serve the noted needs. For example, every school has to have comfortable fully equipped classrooms, a sport gym and a cafeteria compulsory, and a parking lots, a swimming pool and a yard optionally. When all these needs are met, why can the architects not improve and design it? 
Secondly, the specific, sometimes peculiar design of the buildings makes the whole city look different. The design features and architecture style of the city, especiaslly of the historic city center, determines and influences the mindset and the whole worldview of the citizens and tourists. Moreover, statistics says, that people who face a lot of breathtaking scenaries, including urban ones, tend to be more happy and curious in a beneficial way. 
One more solid argument in support of the art of architecture is tourism. Why would we need to travel if all cities look the same? The cultural heritage of various countries would be lost, if architects only paiy attention to the buildings' functionality. The last, but not the least reason why we need multiple types of urban design is simply not to get lost. It is sometimes challenging to find the route through the chain of the streets and building looking the same. 
By the way of conclusion I would like to express my opinion about the statements freely. Personally, i totally disagree with it and suppose that the city planning is the marvelous way to show creativity.

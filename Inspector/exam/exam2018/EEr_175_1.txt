The charts describe which courses are attended by how many people belonging to three different age groups. 
More than a half of all the students who attend the science courses are 18-25 years old. Almost one-third of the students are 26-40 years old, while the rest are from the age group of 40 and above. 
The arts courses are most loved by the older students: a total of 45 percent of the arts students are 40 years old and above. The rest of the attendants are 18-25 and 26-40 years of age in almost equal measure. 
An impressive 62 percent of students who attend the sports and health courses are 26-40, while the younger and older age groups tend to avoid choosing the block: only 38 percent of the attendants are younger than 26 or older than 39. 
Overall, around 600-650 students attend each block of courses, arts being the least popular and science courses the most attended block.

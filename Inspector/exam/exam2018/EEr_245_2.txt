There are many exciting buildings nowadays. All of them have their own purposes: some of them using by people for living, others - for working and so on. But architects often do not think about its appearance, because they reckon that it is not necessary for building to be beautiful. 
I cannot fully agree with this people because the appearance of buildings, especially in big cities, has a crucial importance, as it demonstates the heritage of the city. There are a lot of different great buildings, which are known for us from the history. For example, the Kremlin. This building refletcs some points of our history, our culture. And it is the example of why people need to build beautiful buildings. 
Moreover, arcitects should pay the attention of producing buildings that are works of art, as it is the "face" of our country. Every city and town need to have at least one great building because it is an attraction of this place. For example, when foreigners come to Moscow, they see Moscow city Towers and understand that the scale of power of our country is very high. And after they come back and show the photos with such buildings, they tell about perfect look of Russia. 
In conclusion I would like to say that it is both quite important to serve the purpose of building and to make it beautiful. But it should be marked that the appearance of buildings is also very considerable reason to pay the attention of this issue, as it reflecs the traditions and values of the country and makes the sight more attractive.

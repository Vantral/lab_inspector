There is an opinion that architects should create buildings paying more attention on the purpose of the building than on the visual appearance of it. This essay mostly agrees with this point of view. Here I will explain why. 
From the ancient times people tended to create an enormously beautiful buildings even when it was not that simple. We can now see it all over our planet, meet in pictures of the galleries and etc. It happened because humans do have a sence of aesthetics. It is not enough just to build an office, it should also look nice, with all the possible ways to make it stylish. If humanity would not have this strong will to make things better, prettier, the world would look terrible. 
But if there is a strict choice between beauty and quality of the building, architects should choose the quality. A well built house will remain roughly the same even after many centuries while maybe a really beautiful one but with the lack of good materials will be ruined after a few decades. I guess that the best variant is to create both professionally designed, good looking building with a nice projected floors and with the usage of materials that will last long giving people the atmosphere of safeness. 
In the situation where architects should make a decision to create a whether beautiful or serving its purpose building, they should choose to make a really good house but with the lack of the design. But in the reality a building should be both aesthetically good and well built.

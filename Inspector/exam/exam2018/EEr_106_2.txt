Nowadays humanity is able to build almost everything: it is not an dilemma anymore to make the strangest projects real. However, now people face a new problem which is the balance between usability of building and its view. In this essay I will take a close look at this issue. 
So, some people believe that it is more important for architects to create buildins without caring about it beauty and this is a reasonable point of view. First of all, nowadays there are many houses which architecture is gorgeous but their inside is planned poorly in the sake of outside beauty. Moreover, some of these buildings are built with weak materials which are easy to break and that is a real problem speaking about the safety. 
On the other hand, it is just more pleasurable to live or work in beautiful place rather than stay at building looking like a box or coffin with its small space and little windows. Bright colors, smooth lines and lovely decorations influences on person's mood in a positive way which is quite important since houses are built for people. Also, the overall view of the city changes greatly when architectures try hard creating building that are good enough to be called a work of art. People do their best to improve towns and it is always a pleasure to go sightseeing in countries full of beautiful structures. 
Summing up, I want to say that I disagree with the opinions saying that the view of building is not significant. Of course, it is important for every house to serve its purpose but there have to be something to enjoy, so, creating a beautiful design of a building is still important. Let's not forget about pleasure for our souls and eyes because our life is complicated and boring enough to refuse even the smallest chance to paint it with bright colors.

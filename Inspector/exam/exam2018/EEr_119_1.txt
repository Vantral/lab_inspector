The graph shows how the percentage and distibution of difference in earnings between men and women is likely to change in 15-year period (from 1980 to 1995) in five countries. 
First of all, the diagram provides a tendedency of decreasing the difference in income for all countries. General idea is that in 1980 the difference was very high (from 20 to 40 percent in all regions), but by 1995 it became less (from 12 to 30 percent). By the way, there were fluctations during 1980 and 1995 (in Germany, for example, after 1890 difference between men and women income started to grow). So, we can see that there was no slightly decrease between years. 
Closer look to the data reveals that in some parts of the world decreasing was much more predictable than in others. In Japan lack of equalence reached its top in 1985 (42 per cent), while in other countries in that year the percent of difference was much less than in 1980 and they had theie maximums in the first year, presented in the graph. There were two groups of countries. The first one included three high-developed countries (Japan, USA, UK) and had a highest percent of difference (35-40 %) in 1980. Germany and New Zealand also had close values in 1980 year, but they were abot twise lower than the values of the first group (20-23%). 
Moreover, diagram shows that in some counties the difference between the items in 1980 and 1995 significant high, while in others it was not so huge. The Unated States had great falling of difference in earning (it decrease in about a half), whereas the UK fell only in 10 per cent. 
All in all, the general tend is that all five countries showed the minimisation of dufference in income between men and women, but in some parts of the world the falling was significantly higher than in others.

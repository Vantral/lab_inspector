In the modern world the topis about urbanistics are widely discussed in the society. Some people are sure that buildings should look beautiful. Others argue that beauty is not the most important purpose for it and architets is not abot it. I think that here should be a balance between opinions. 
First of all, inordinary buildigs decorate cities and help citizens to forget about daily routine. Often it becomes popular places to meet, to walk and to relax for everybody. In my opinion, the Zaryadie park in Moscow is a good example for this point of view. Meanwhile, some buildings can be liked not by all people and then will be a lot of those, who are against these projects. 
Moreover, interesting architecture of buildings attracts a lot of travellers from different part of the world. It is an extra income for cities and countries. Hotels, cafes, shops and other parts of the touristic indusrty develop economics. On the other side, a big variety is not always good to the city. Different styles of architecture in one place distract atmosphere in the city. For example, if in the city center of old European city people build a contemporary skyscraper, it will be disgusting. 
To sum up, I would like to say that the main for every city is that it should be attractive and convinient for all citizens and tourists. Understandable transport system, parks, shops are obligatory for every modern city as buildings and good people whoo care about it.

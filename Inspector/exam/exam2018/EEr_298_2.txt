Not many people think of architecture as an art medium nowadays. Some architects of the past have been praise for some of their creations as it wasr regarded as a work of art, however, our contemporaries believe that the functions of a building must recieve more attention than its appearance. This essay will discuss this subject and give a personal point of view. 
To my mind, arcitects should definitely not overlook the looks of their creations, because they are as important as the structure of theirs. It is worth mentioning that a steady and reliable living space is important for dwellers who live in hazardous areas such as Japan, where an earthquake can easily destroy a badly built house. But only a minority of people would agree to live in a dull-loking house. There are many pieces of evindence that repeating patterns and lack of pleasing surroundings may be damaging for one's satisfaction level and in some cases even lead to depression. Therefore, it is an architects duty to produce a construction plan, which follows safety and does not avoid beauty concerns. 
Furthermore, an experienced specialist may achieve a sustainability of a building, while still preserving its aesthetically pleasing appearance. For instance, a library in Hainan is famous for its attractive, yet functional planning of bookshelves. Their design resemples a ladder, which provides an easy access for remotly placed books as well as maintains a minimalistic beauty of a simple bookshelf. 
To conclude, there certainly are ways of making both functional and elegant construction for a willing architect. There is no denying that a building should serve its purpose. Nonetheless, architecture industry should strive to remain itself a form of art and try not to become some form of manufactory.

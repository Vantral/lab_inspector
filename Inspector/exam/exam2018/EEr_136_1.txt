This graph shows a difference between five countries in the percantage of energy from fossil fuels in them in a period from 1970 to 2015. China is in a middle point of the graph during first thirty years but after it growed up. In that year it was replaced with United States. On the other hand, earlier UK were in the highest point. France and Sweden that which also were leaders falled and were at the bottom to the 2015. On the other hand, India that was on the bottom became one of the leaders to the end of the period which we are seeing. It is an extraordinary change.

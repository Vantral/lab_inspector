Nowadays there are many people who suppose family to impact childs most, but there is another point of view, sometimes friends and school considered to influence child even more. 
I would like to start with an utterance: tell me who is your friend and I will tell who you are. It means that people with whom we spend a lot of time, to whom we believe (in other words, our friends) will form our habits, points of view, etical and aesthetical position. Actually it is one of the prerequisites of behaviorism, a psychological movement, which claims that everything in our character and temperament was formed in childhood by the enviroment. 
Thus (if you are behaviorist) you may say, family will mostly impact on child in early childhood. But as soon as he starts communicate with the world by himself, he will be changed by his friends and classmates, let alone teachers. 
On the other hand, there are psychological movement which supposes that the main features of our character is already formed when we are born. From this point of view, it is neither family nor friends who develops the character of the child, it is only biology and brain. 
As for me, I would rather support the theory of behaviorism, but it seems to me, that the impact of family is still bigger, because the earlier you get something, the stronger you believe in those things; the purest ideals are usually formed in the brain of the child, who take everything without critizising. 
In conclusion I would like to say that all the experiens we get as pupils or teenagers is going to be based on our picture of the world, and this picture is formed by family in our childhood.

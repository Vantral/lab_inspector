The table and bar chart which are presented provide us with the information about problem of overweight among children in Canada. The bar chart illustrates the chages during one timeframe from 1985 to 2005 while the table shows the data of percentage of those who did activities regularly considering period from 1990 to 2005. The number of overweight Canadian children almost reached 30 per cent, neverthess, the number of those who did sport also went up. 
Firstly, in the bar chart, we observe that from 1985 to 1990 there were more girls than boys who had obesity. What is more, in 1995 the numbers remain the same, just 16 per cent. Otherwise, during 5 years, from 2000 to 2005, the number of boys climbed sharply from 21 to 25 per cent, while the percentage of girls gradually rose nerly 22 per cent. 
If we look at features in the table, we can see that percentage of girls and boys who did regular exercises increased through years. 51 per cent of girls turned to 77 per cent whereas 57 per cent of boys became 87 per cent. 
All things considered, we can summerize all up that through the years Canadian children are overweight but though they did regularly some activities.

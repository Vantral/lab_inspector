It is often argued that the family makes the biggest influence on a child as some people believe that the society outside the family like friends or classmates influences more. In my opinion, the greatest part in every child's development plays his or her family. 
Firstly, it is scientifically proved that the most important years of every person's life are the first 5 years of existance. In this period of time a child gets an incredible amount of information, learns to walk and talk and his or her own personality starts to form and develop. Though classmates, teachers and friends may make a huge impact on a person, during this important period a child mainly communicates with his family. For example, there are lots of people who have attitudes or tastes that are similar to those of his parents even though they do not notice them at all. It is because of these highly important early years spent with the family. 
Secondly, it is a quite often situation when a person choose his or her parent as a role model. Lots of people all over the world try to imitate mother's or father's behaviour as they consider it as an excellent one. It is also obvious that many people choose for role models some famous people like movie stars. However, this type of imitation is not so successful as the first one as a person is aware of only few aspects of a role model's life, while he or she knows a mother or a father extremelly good. A person can copy not only certain manners but a whole pattern of behaviour. For example, my sister had nothing in common with my mother until her marriage and now she treats her children just how our mother treated us. 
To conclude, the family influances greatly on a child as it goes with him through the early ages and, moreover, parents are often choosen as role models.

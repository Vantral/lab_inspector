The pie charts demonstrate the percentage of people of three different age groups who attended science, atrs and sports and health courses in 2012 in one of the UK colleges
The main age groups presented are the elderly who are 40 or older, the middle-aged who are at the age from 26 to 40 and the youth beginning from 18 and up to 25 years old. The total average number of students in all the graphs is from 600 to 650 people. 
All the three types of courses were mostly popular with the three different age groups. Science courses became interesting for more than a half of young students. Arts classes were popular among the older people and the middle-aged prefered spending their time on keeping fit and maintaining their health - 62 percent attended sports and health courses. 
Concerning the less widespread age groups of students of these courses, it is seen that the eldery are not that interested both in science and sport. On average one fourth of them visit these courses. The 30 percent of the middle aged are interested in science and even fewer students are into arts. On the contrary, the young are fond arts more than into health.

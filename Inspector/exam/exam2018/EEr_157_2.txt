These days, a lot of new houses and buildings are designed. Some people claim the most crusious thing for architecture is to serve needs of people, whereas opponents suggest we should have not solely useful infrastructure, but also art objects in our everyday life. 
I completely desagree with those, who see only practical purposes in using architecture and I try to explain my point of view in this essay. 
It is clear from the history that people dreamed to make their living places as beautiful as possible. The reachest have built huge houses and cottages, while the poorest have had only small flats but trying to make them more beautiful inside. Independing on the amount of money humans have had they always try to make the world around them pretty. THat is way architects recieved so much money in the times of kings. It was important for poor people especially to have fascinated disigned buildings in the streets even they could not afford them for themselves. 
Another example of the importance of art architecture is the appeareance of an each city and a whole country. In other words, if in a land there are good-looking buildings, the place attracts tourists and can make these objects seesights and improve economics in some time. 
In conclusion, an unimportant relation on the look of new buildings is worringly high because people need to appreciate arts in modern world not execlusevely in museums but also in routine life. Art objects around humans can demonstrate them the importance of beauty for comfortable living in each place, to high a historical prestige of the city in terms of cultural objects, and to attract tourists to the country.

In our time are saved a lot of historical buildings all around the world. We admire, because this buildings serve its purpose for years. All the time architects built beautiful buildings, but serve they its purpose? 
By my opinion, if architect want to build something what will stay in history for a long time, he build something not tipical, interesting and he works with art, to create something beutiful, and sometimes can forget about how long it will be saved. For example, the building in the Rome, were people every day do a billion photos. But why? Because this bulding is very old and it serve its purpose, of corse, something is broken, but specialy this makes this building not tipical and interesting for people all around the world. In the modern world, architects try to create buildings for a long time. I think it's because they use a lot of time and money, and they try to do a good building which will serve for a long time. In our world we have a million talented architects which every day think about how to create something new, what nobody built. And i think that it's more important to built and create only good buldings which will serve for a hundred and more years, but it is important to not forget about this to look beauty and special, not like everything around us. 
It's too hard to be special and good architect in the world, were everyone of them wants to build something new, and to be in history like a great architect. But they shouldn't forget that they buildings should be not just beautiful, but and for a long time.

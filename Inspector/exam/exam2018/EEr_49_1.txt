Both the chart and the table gives information about children, but when the chart provides information about children who have problems with weight during 20 years, the table is shown how many children did sport in one country during the same period. 
During the whole period the number of children with obesity was increased: while in 1985 there were only 12% of girls and 11% of boys, in 2005 year there were 22% of girls and 25% of boys. The amount of children who did different kinds of sport were also changed: from the the table below we can see that in 1990 there were only 51% of girls and 57% of boys, while in 2005 there were 77% of active girls and 87% of such boys. 
Overall, we can see the connection between the chart and the table. While the number of children with obesity is growing, the amount of children who did sport is also growing.

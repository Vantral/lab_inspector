Modern technologies allow us to construct and create amazing, mindblowing buildings. Many of recently built houses, offices and malls look more like pieces of art rather then housing, working or comersial facilities. However, some people think that arcitecture and design are much less important than the original purposes of a building: comfort, safety and convenience. 
Personally, I believe that a building should be pleasant both functionally and visually. Any house, office, mall or other place should meet all the requirements, obtained both from the government and the environmental and other conditions, and at the same time be good looking and well functioning. To put it in other words, I would prefer a comfortable and ordinary looking house rather than an inconvenient but artisctically designed one. 
On the other hand, I think cities and towns would look really boring if all the buildings had common, standard exteriors. As for me, it is nice to have one or two unusually looking buildings in your local area. Those can be public buildings like libraries, galleries, cinemas or museums - places, that people just visit from time to time. They are also very popular among tourists and might make some additional income. Such buildings always bring something new, untraditional to the look of an ordinary street and make it feel more interesting, more like home rather than just a place, where you have to live. 
To sum up, a good building is one that combines modern, interesting design and all the essential properties of a house, an office, etc., such as being safe, efficient and comfortable.

The graph below indicates the corelation between how much activity boys and girls did with the number of overweight boys and girls between 1985 and 2005. It is clearly seen that girls in general do less physical work than boys and share a larger percentage of overweight people. 
As we can see the table shows us that only 51% of girls in 1990 and 77% of girls in 2005 tend to do any kind of physical activity while 57 % of boys in 1990 and 87% of boys in 2005 do physical activity regulary. 
This results in only 11 to 16 percentage of overweight boys from 1985 to 1995 and 12 to 16 percentage of overweight girls in the same years. Then the percentage gradually changes and shows the opposite correlation. From 1995 to 2005 there are more overweight boys than girls.

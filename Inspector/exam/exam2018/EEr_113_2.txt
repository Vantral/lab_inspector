It is a question, what we will choice between look beatiful and main purpose of building. 
Nowdays we can observe a lot of differents architectures styles in the cities. Today human being has a great possibilyties and moderns technologies to creat new beautifull building. Also, a great architecture in all times has a lot of benefites. For example, it can bring money, because of increasing tourists in a city. 
In other hand, it takes more time and efforts. And it can create some problems, for example the building become less stressfull und strond. Also, some people makes no differens between beautiful look of building or standart. They remain position that, firstively, building has to be functional and the other does not important. 
I tend to second point of view, and I think that it is important for a building to serve its purpose than to look beautiful.

There is no doubt that buildings cannot be described only as a special places to live there, work or something else - many years ago people became to build really exciting and beautiful buildings; for them buildings was not only buildings, they were a special kind of art. Nowadays some people believe that the most important thing for buildings is to serve their purpose. I tend not to believe in it and now I tell you why I think so. 
To begin with, buildings around you can change your life. In my opinion, if you see beautiful and colorful buildings every day, you became happier. It is very important, because life in big cities is stressful, so people should have more positive things in their days. 
Secondly, all over the time people, who has a lot of money, always do not want to be like other people. I think, really amazing building is an excellent way to be another. If you see a big house with great sculptures on it, you of course decide that it is a rich man's house. 
Contrastly, there are a lot of people that are not love modern art, so they can decide not to buy a flat only because the architects, who made the buildg, did something very special and modern. I think, there are not many people who wants to live, to illustrate, in a house, that is fallen (there is one in Praga), only art-lovers. But these buildings can be not only house, I think, it is a very good idea for a mall, for example. 
To conclude, buildings are important thing of our social life. That is why buildings should be works of art, but only if they are relevant to use them.

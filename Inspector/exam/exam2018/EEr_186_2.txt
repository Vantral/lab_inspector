Nowadays, in the century of technologies and the variety of workplaces, there are two popular points of view on the destinction between the amount of money and free time. Some poeple suggest that it is more important to have more income, while others suppose that free time is more crutial. In my opinion, money are more prevalent. There are some arguments in favour of my view. 
First of all, it is a well-known utterence that money is our everything. 
In order to be satisfied and have a high-quality life people need money. In addition, every our need has it's own price. For instance, we pay to medical workers and for drugs that can help us to cure, we pay for transportation, relaxation and even education. Having considered these examples, it is obvious that without money people are hardly to achive anything. 
Moving on to the next argument, free time is just a waste of time for almost everyone. In other words, time management is pretty rare ability among people. Moreover, if someone did not have any responsibilities, he would just stay at home and draw a line under any importent stuff. According to statistics, approximately 70 percent of poeple do not remember theit leisure time, while only 30 per cent of whose who are able to have an advantage from their free time. 
In conclusion, summing up all the arguments, I would like to say that there are some downturns in prefering free time to money, such as unproductive waste of time and disability to provide ourselves with everyday needs. If pople want to live and enjoy their life, they should earn money first, and only after that try to find a minute of their free time.

In our modern world, people givee a lot of attention to the appearnce o the cities where they live. People always to improve some details of the buildings, make them more attractive for others. there is an opinion that there is more important for building to be used for its purpose rather than look pretty and the architects don't need to make sense of it at all. But as for me, it is sagnifically important to care about how buildings look like and it is obvious that they must be look gorgeous. And I will prove my opinion with several reasons. 
First of all, it can be said that as more attractive the city looks, as more it attracts tourists from different parts of the world. And the tourism can be very helpful for the economics of the country. ALso, the appearance of the city can point to the level of the development of it, which is also important for the country. For example, in Moscow you always can see very gorgeous buildings in the centre of the city, which is used as offices or shops. GUM is the best example of this. 
What is more, the modern architecture consists of different styles and destinations, which can be used in a lot of ways, so in fact it is more comfortable and convinient for people to work in beautiful buildings, where there are offices inside, for example. The problem is that in the past people often worried that their houses looked so old and not attractive. Often it can be the reason why people moved to another cities or even countries. But nowadays the situation was changed, and houses mixed these factors. 
In conclusion, the target for the architects to create a convinient buildings which will be better for future life.

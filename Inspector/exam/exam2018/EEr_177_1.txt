The three charts in question display the total numbers of students attending each of the three course types, with each chart displaying proportions of different age groups attending. It can be noted that although total numbers of attendees per course are rather similar, their age group structure varies drastically. 
For every course type there is an age group to which a simple majority of students belongs. For the science courses it is the 18-25 year old age group, for the arts courses the most numerous group is 40 years old and above and the sports and health courses are mostly attended by the students from the 26-40 years old age group. It is therefore evident that for every course type there is a different age group that constitutes a majority. Another notable feature represented by these charts is that for every course type with an exeption of arts courses it is true that the majority group also accounts for more than fifty percent of students attending, while in the arts courses none of the age groups accounts for an absolute majority of attendees.

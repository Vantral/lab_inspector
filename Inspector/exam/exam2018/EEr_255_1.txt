The graph provides information about amounts of energy that five different countries extract from fossil fuels. Overall, there are five countries, which are China, United States, India, Sweden and France. It is clear from the graph that China showed the highest rate in 2015, while Sweden had the smallest. 
First of all, it is evidently seen that Sweden had one of the highest level of energy from fossil fuels in 1970, more than four fifths of all the energy, but then it decreased dramatically and in 1990 it was less than a half, then, it continued to decline slowly. 
Secondly, United States have significant percentage. The graph illustrates that in 1970 all the energy in UNited States was from fossil fuels, then, it slightly decreased and in 2015 it was only about two tenth less (83 per cent). Going back to China it is clear, that in 1970 they had more than a half of energy from fossils, then it increased slightly and in 2015 it was the highest amount among mentioned 5 countries (approximately 90 per cent).

Some people think that the main goal for the building is to serve it's purpose and architects do not need to think about how beatiful is the bulding, but others do not agree. Let us try to compare these two opinions. 
Personnaly I strongly dissagree with this point of view and consider that every building should be beautiful. Firstly, architecture is the ancient form of art, people always have been trying to make their bulding bigger, greater and of course, more beutiful. If architectects no longer care about the beaty of their works, the humanity will lost the great form of art. 
Secondly, stunning buildig can have a great effect on economic of the country. Eye-catching artworks can be interesting for the tourists from abroud. It is important to make streets in all cityes in the country from little towns to megapolices more beautifull, and this way brilliant architecture can provide the regural income from tourizm. 
However, there is an opinion, that thinking about the beaty of the bulding, architects forget about its main purporse. I consider that nowadays there are a lot of competitions in architecture projects, so government can choose a project, in which the building is a btiliant artwork and serves its purposes in the same time. 
Taking into the consideration all mentioned above I want to emphasize that I tottaly disagree with the opinion that the beauty is not important and consider that the main aim for a great architect should be to do the building both beautifull and useful.

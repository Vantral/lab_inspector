Every day we, as city dwelllers, are surrounded by buildings. We cannot help but notice if a house looks aesthetically appealing or not. However, is external beauty more valuable than practicality and functional purposes? In this essay I will share my opinion on this debatable topic. 
I strongly believe that if an architect were to choose between functionality and beauty of a building the latter can be abandoned. When we enter a building, we do not really care about its exterior, we only spend time inside, so there is no need for outside decorations, as they do not serve any practical purpose. As for the inside, the lack of beauty and harmony in shapes and colors can cause slight discomfort at best. However, a problem in functionality can do as much as put people in danger and disturb their working process. Functional flaws do not allow the building to fulfill all of its purposes and turn it into a harmful environment. For example, an extravagant architectural detail that was made in disregrard of safety can cause death of injury by falling onto someone's head. 
There are people who would argue and say that being around ugly constructions every day can affect one's mental health and discourage them from leaving the house and doing their work. Of course, this is true, but consider this: if all buildings were made to be practical rather than aesthetically pleasing, would people not get used to it? Wouldn't they learn to see beauty in functionality and comfortable, user-friendly designs? 
To conclude, I would say that an ideal architect should be able to find a healthy balance between those two characteristics and not have to sacrifice one in favour of the other. But if a choice had to be made, in my opinion, practicality would have to be the winnner.

A generation ago buildinds made a huge impact of people s life. Nowadays it is continuing. Building reflects all emotions and mood of the architecture and gives these sences to the human. People should use buildings in right way - in theatre people should watch acts, in cinemas - films and cartoons. Architecture is certainly which is often discussed in today s world. 
It is argued by some people that acrhitecture should be used for its purpose. A very good example here is aschool. At school pupils get a lot of information from different spheres and nowhere else they cannot get new facts and skills. Further more it does not matter how the school is looks, of course it is very crucial that school should be safety ,but it is more important what actions pupils do inside of the building. 
Yet, others believe that it does not matter for what aim this builing was built, more important is how the builing looks. For instance, many outstanding and ancient builinds,for example museums were rebuilt or recovered and they lost their previous look. As a consequence young generation will not see and know building of last century. They will not get information of this building and will not know legendary people who were related for this building. This building is not a work of art, it is only modern building. 
I would argue that it is more crucial for architecture to serve its purpose than to look gorgeous and brilliant. First of all, buildings were built to use them in particular aim. And nobody think about beautiful this building or not. Architectors think only about of quantity of building and about useful features.

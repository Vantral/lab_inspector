Unlike painting, music, or sculpture, architecture is more functional. Amazing builings created by famous architects all over the world are used by people for living, organizing cultural events, working. Some may think that creating complex architectual designs is a waste of money and time because they are made for everyday use. There is, of course, an opposite opinion: it is important to build higly aesthetical houses, museums, and business centres because they transform the space they occupy and affect people who come here on a daily basis. 
To my mind, architecture is art. It should be beautiful and inspiring, but also functional and made for people. Firstly, architects, since they are artists, need to be able to communicate with public by suggesting their vision of communal and personal spaces, places of art, of work, of grieving, enterteiment... Secondly, they have to adress users coherentely, allowing them to navigate their works and enter the dialogue that these artists are seeking. 
Architecture is a complicated branch of human craft. It started as a means of exisiting and surviving but these days it is a means of communication and interaction. Both "user-friendliness" and meaningful design is essential for every blueprint made by an architect. As it was said earlier, architecture is art, a form of the dialogue between creator and user, aesthetics and functionality, it is place where people meet.

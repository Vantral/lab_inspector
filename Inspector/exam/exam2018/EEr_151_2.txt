Nowadays all people are surrounded by stress and feel theirselves always under pressure. We are living in the big city with noise and air pollutions, with a big colourless similar buildings. We should cope with stress permanently. To my mind, the beauty in our life is one of those things which could help us to do this. That is why i am absolutely shure that it is very important for architectors to create something beautiful and unusual. There are enough typical building in Moscow which are remains of Soviet times. There is nothing surprising in this case that this areas with hundreds of similar buildg considered to be the most depressive. Actually, i dont mean that every building should be piece of art, sometimes it look too strange and too hard for perception. But when modern technologies are going further i cannot believe that it is impossible now to create beautiful bilding, which will serve it`s purpose in both times. The main problem of course is that in building sphere investors and other peopeles which are involved in process are mostly think about moneys, not about beauty.

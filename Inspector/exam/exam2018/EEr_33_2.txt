Currently the world face a huge amount of daily issues and there are so many people that it is more rational that governments should concentrate on helping their own civilians only. I partly agree with the statement as it is hardly possible to tackle problems of all people in the world and it is better to narrow the focus to get a greater effect. 
To start with, population is the basis of any country so the prosperity of a state depends on people's level of satisfaction. Thus, governments try to meet needs of their people and provide them with the crucial facilities. For example, when organising the state budget the significant chunk of money should go for different social issues and services improvements, such as care homes, kindergartens and schools funding. 
Another point why it is so important for governments to put their population on the first position is that people contented with their lives and those who see lots of opportunities to thrive will never leave the country that provides them with such conditions. This way, modernizing various aspects of social life, governments extend the number of potential successful labour force. 
However, ignoring problems of the other countries also can be harmful both for international relationships and for economy. So, there are different programmes for emigrants and refugees in the developed countries. These people also can have a beneficial impact to the state's labour system. 
To sum everything up, governments need to focus on the problems of people in their countries mostly as it is the immense aspect of further development. But cooperating with other states and people is still an important point.

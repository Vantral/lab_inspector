There are two opinions about what should architects care more. On the one hand, people think that producing buildings is more important then how did they look like and in the other hand, to make buildings look beautiful is the first thing what architects should care for. 
In my opinion, architects should worry about how do they built. It is not important is it a house or a work of art. People lives in their flats with warm feeling of protection. Nobody wants their home to be ruined. If we talk about large and massive work of art, this is the same situation. Firstly, no one wants to die if this work of art will fall or breake. Secondly, every architect want his works live as long as possible. If his statue or painting cracked or colours will not be as bright as it was after several years, it would be disapointment for creator. If it wont influense on peoples lifes or their cars and houses it is not that bad but just imagine if the Efel Tower will fall down? Under this tower are so many cars an people. Any skyscraper in New York should be very strong. Not all of them looks beautifull and gogerous but no one will fall down. And if it will, it will not touch another one because of architects work. 
But there are some people who think that you should built a gogerous peace of art and dont care about the safity. For example, the Statue in New York. It stays on a peace of grownd near the city and if something destroy it everyone will be safe. 
I think that architects should care about their works as if they will live in this houses or near statue. Art should be fun and inspiring not fritenning.

The graph reflects the information about how the difference in earnings between men and women in five countries changed between 1980 and 1995. It can be clearly seen that in general Germany is the country where the percentage number of the wage gap between two sexes is the least salient (fluctuated between 10% and 23%), whereas that of Japan is the highest (from 30% to 40%). Therefore, the percentage number of the latter is almost twice as much than that of the former. Overall, there was a downward trend in all of the countries observed netween 1980 and 1995: the percentage number in Japan, the UK, and New Zealand started decreased slightly after 1985, while that in the USA and Germany fell steadily after 1980. All the countries witnessed this number being at its lowest in 1995, except Germany, which lowest percentage number was in 1990. All in all, all countries underwent a decrease in the observant period.

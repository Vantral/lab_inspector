Many people adopt the viewpoint that importance of serving purposes of buildinds is more important than its view, and architects should not worry about art buildings. From my perspective, the purpose is a prevaluable point, but the view of buildings should be looked esthetitcly. 
On the one hand, it is also important to make the building which can defend people in it at the time of some problems, connected with nature. Earthquakes, for example, can destroy a huge number of buildings. The same problems happen in Japan three or more times per year, for example. Besides, the comfort in the building prevalues on its beautiful view. If people feel comfortable in it, they do not think about the walls of building outside. 
On the other hand, the buildings are the fundametal point of cities, and its view can have an influence on some emotions of people, which are at that city. To my mind, grey and glassed walls of buildings can have an influense on psychology mood citizens; it is very difficult to live in the city which buildings are similar and unattractive. Obviously, if the buildings are beautiful, but not well-made, the happiness cannot continue a long period of time. Thus, people who really live there, not tourists, cannot feel protection and cannot be sure that one or another building can stay on its plase for a long time. Another theme is tourists who visit cities only for glazing at architecture. Frequently, this architecture is antient or presents the middle centuries as in Barselona, for examle, or Paris. In spite of it, architects should think about a practice of building, because there are a lot of another wonderful buildings nowadays, they should pay attention to its purposes. 
To draw a conclusion, the creative and wonderful view of buildings is magnificent point, of course, but its undangerous advantages are more important.

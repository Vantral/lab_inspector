In the given graphs the information is presented on the topics of the overweight of girls and boys (in a form of a bar chart) and regular physical activity among boys and girls (in a form of a table). 
From the bar chart we can point out that there is an increasement in the percentage rate as for boys and girls. Before 1995, the percentage of overweight girls was higher than the one of the boys, but in 1995 the numbers of percentage became equal. From 1995 to 2005, a major increasement can be tracked in the percentage of boys' overweight, that became higher, that the girls' one. 
From the table we can state that in 1990 boys were the majority that did physical activity with a 57%, but the difference from the girls was not that big - only 6%. In 2005, the tendency of boys being a majority remained, but the difference experienced an increasement - 10%. General tendency shows that in a period of 15 years both boys and girls had an increasement in doing physical activity.

Humanity faces millions of problems on daily bases, there are people in need worldwide. There is a statement that governments should pervent those types of situations only in their own countries. 
My opinion on this topic is rather clear - I totally disagree with the following statement. The main point is to help every person in need to overcome the struggles. There are many countries in our planet, some of them are rich and wealthy, some of them are poor and seeking for help. If the rich country is able to create and maintain the peace inside, it can also help the others outside, because it has the ability to do so. It has the resources that can be given for the people of unwealthy countries - for example, Europe send tons of food and pure water to African continent annualy. This kind desicion saves numerous lives. Speaking about other agruments, I would like to point out the problem of war. The citizens of the countries that are in war are looking for shelters because staying in the region of fighting and battle is unsecure. For instance, recently Germany has provided Syrian refugees with shelters in its own territory. Thousands of families with little infants have found their new home and live their happy life since then. Other countries in Europe did the same thing, opening their borders for Syrians in need. 
To conclude, I would like to underline the key idea of my point of view - having the ability to help the others would definately save millions of lives. There will always be countries that need something and countries that can give it. It is possible to create peace in our planet and this is the main goal of hmanity.

In our modern day and age the problem of helping is essential. We live in the time of globalization. It means that people become closer and closer. Because of this, I believe that global society should try to help its separat parts and a nation or a country does not matter. This essay is going about my personal opinion and an alternative point of view. 
Firstly, because of globalization there is a variety of global problems that are a damage for the whole society. In this case, for example, I mean terrorism, global warming, and thingslike that. To prevent these problems people from all over the world should united. in addition to this, only together humanity could achieve peace and quite. Secondly, talking about natural catastrifies or thing like famine, global siciety should give a helping hand to suffering countries. The idea is that nawadays there are developed, developing countries and ones of the third world and they are not equal in their posibilities. Therefore developed countries should support countries that are poor and powerless. 
However, the different point of view, an alternative one, exists among people minds. people belive thst government shoul support only their own country and solve their own problems. Obviously, it is useful point when the country is powerless and does not have enough power to role the world, but even cannot help itself. So, in this case government should develop their own country's economic to achieve wealth in social, cultural and economic sphere of social life. 
All in all, in globalization time where information, diseases, wars and so on spread like wildfire, people should help each other not only in country's bondaries but break them and build global strong society.

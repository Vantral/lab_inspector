Some people consider the beauty of a building to be less meaningful than the way it functions. Others argue that any work of architecture should also be attractive. Let us look at both sides of this controversial question to see who is right. 
From my perspective, it is undoubtedly important that architects continue to create beautiful buildings which also serve as works of art. First of all, the architecture shapes the portrait of any city or town and the way it is perceived by the citizens and visitors. It is more pleasant to walk in the streets with colourful and unusual buildings, which also attracts many tourists and contributes to the town's economy. Cities like Vienna, Rome or Paris are well-known examples that represent the meaning of architecture in the number of visitors. 
Secondly, the visual surrounding impacts the psychological well-being significantly. No diversity in the architectural view of a town, especially combined with bad weather, can lead to depressive conditions. Various research has been carried out to demonstrate the direct influence of the landscape on emotional state of an individual. 
One may argue that creating such stunning buildings could cost too much for small towns. Still, there is a lot of evidence that the benefits of beautiful architectural projects outweight the spendings. They encourage people to visit the town or city, as well as strengthen the connection of the citizens to their home, ensuring that they do not move to another place and continue working and living where they were born. 
All in all, there are both advantages and disadvantages to this problem; thus, each country and region can decide whether architecture is worth spending money on. However, I find it extremely important that we surround ourselves with beautiful buildings that also satisfy the needs of people.

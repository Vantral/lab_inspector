Some people think that serving its purpose is more important for a building than its appearance and that architects, those job is to make buildings beautiful, 
should not try hard to do so. As for me, I cannot agree with this opinion. 
To begin with, there are a lot of amazingly looking buildings which are also highly used and safe inside. I have seen a lot of these in Moscow, for instance GUM or the Bolshoy Theatre. Some buildings can be real works of art, people even come to see them from far countries and other continents. Does that not proof an importance of building's appearance? I consider a poor looking building to be unattractive
meaning that some people would be not even willing to go there or interested in knowing that services it offers. In addition, there is a job of an architect and
what they do is admirable and in my opinion, no one will benefit if there is not such a job anymore. More than that, many people work in tourist industry, and beautiful buildings, which are all over the world, make them a lot of profit. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that we are living in the 21st century, there art is all around us, buildings can also impress and make us think of something new and most of all, we should appreciate what others do.

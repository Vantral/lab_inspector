Countries should concentrate on their own citizens mostly without paying attention to other countries. As for me, I disagree with this statement. In my view, governments should take care of their own citizens and help other countries, if they really need. 
On the one hand, some people truly believe that government should only focus on their country and its citizens. Firstly, every country has its own infrastructure and its policy, so they can and have to do everything what they really need without any other help, because the government has a lot of tools to take care of their citizens. Secondly, an international intervention may escalate the conflict and as a result even the war may rage. Thirdly, every country has its own budget and citizens pay taxes for it and they pay it with the aim to get better quality of life, but not to know that their money were spent on other countries without any benefit for them. 
On the other hand, some people claim that a government should take part not only in the their own country, but also help others. To begin with, different countries have different levels of life, a lot of countries have problems with supply of food or clean water, pollution and many other problems. Sometimes some certain country can't ocercome these serious problems and they have to ask for help, because it is global problems ant they need global solution. What is more, today economies of different countries have strong correlation between each other, and if countries take care about their own citizens mostly they may cause more harm for them. Moreover, sometimes governments helping other counries may benefit from it, owing to some decisions and agreements with other counries. 
To sum up, There are different views and opinions concerning this issue, but people should remember that our countries and our lives strongly depend on each other and sometimes we have to unite, help each other and overcome some serious problems

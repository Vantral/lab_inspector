The charts given present us the data about the percentage of separate groups according to their age engaged in different types of activities in one UK college in 2012. Overall, it is essential to be noted that youngsters tend to attend courses that involve brain activity rather than physical one. Adults from age 26 to 40 prone to do sports, whilst people above 40 years, are likely to be intrested in art courses. 
On the one hand, there is a trend, which shows that it was more prevalent for 55% of young students from age 18 to 25 to attend science courses, which is almost twice more than 25% youngsters chosen arts courses. Moreover, students of this age were not keen on sport: only 15% of them chose sports and health courses which is 4 times less than the proportion of students engaged in scienceand art courses together. 
On the other hand, elder people from age 26-40 prone to do strenous activities: 62% of men and women started doing sports at sports and health courses, which is more than a half. The percentage of students, participating in art courses and in science ones was almost the same: 25% and 30% accordingly. However, persons over 40 were more appealed by arts courses: 45% do this activity, which is triple more than adolescents admiring science and almost twice more than physically active students.

Today people live in hectic times, where there is constant buzz, and people are just sick and tired. The problem of influence in child's life is being discussed here and there. Some people are concerned that family plays the biggest role here, whereas others believe that some other exteternal factors are more powerful. This essay will outline both views and end up with personal opinion. 
To start with, it is worth metioning that people are leaving in fast moving world, where there are constant changes. Therefore, children are more influenced by these changes, for instance, in education. There are electronic boards and diaries and many other things which have a significant influence on in student's life. Moreover, they make friends with other pupils who play a big role in the child's development. 
Another point here is that living in the era of the Internet, children nowadays are prone to sit in front of their computers or tablets all day long. Unfortunatelly, they use these technologies not only for studying, but also for chatting with their friends, watching different videos and plaing games. Without any doubt, all these factorts play a prominent role in children's lifes. 
On the other hand, it is believed that a child gets practically everything from his or her family, starting with some traits of character which are got from parents and ending in giving andvice to children by their relatives. 
Taking everything into consideration, I personally believe that some outside factors influence children more than their family as now people live in the 21st century, where there is Interent all over the globe. One more thing here is that, actually, children are tend to spend more time at school than at home.

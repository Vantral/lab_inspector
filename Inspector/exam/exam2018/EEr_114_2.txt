Architecture is an important part of every city. It is the purpose of travelling for many people. A lot of us love walking around admiring the beaty of the buildings. However, it is not only beauty that makes any building's worth. It is about functionality too. There is a common opinion that it is more important for architects to produce safe and functional buildings rather than amazing masterpieces. 
On the one hand, I agree that there is no use in a beautiful colorful building if it can fall apart any minute. Architecture is not only a decoration for the city but also an environment for work and life. Moreover, one of the most demanded things in life is safety. Architects are in charge for that, so creating a safe and protected space should be a priority for them. 
Nevertheless, visual perception is also really important for people. If we exclude beauty from the list of our priorities, we will finally be surrounded by gray concrete buildings. It will turn our world into a sad place with no colour and no joy. To my mind, a building is like a human - what is inside is important without any doubt, but what is outsides matters too. Architecture is a face of a city, so let it be beautiful and cheerful. 
To sum up, I think that both building's beauty and its purpose should be taken into account in any project. It is necessary to find balance between these two facets of what we expect from architecture to be like.

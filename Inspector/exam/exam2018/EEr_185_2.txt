Nowadays it is important to have some money to live a good life. Most people prefer to earn money and do not have a lot of free time, while others do not want to spend their life only working. I believe that today
it is really important to work and to earn money even if this means
that you have less free time. 
Many people are not ready to work hard and to sucrifice their free time. They
believe that friends and familly are more important than money. I cannot agree with this opinion because I believe that money is a vital part of familly
happiness. For example, I have a brother. He loves his wife and children and wants to spend as much time as possible. Although he is trying to find time
for his family, he had to work a lot and to earn money because having children is expensive. Moreover, my brother and his wife want a third baby,
which means that they have to earn even more. 
There is the second opinion. Others believe that it is really important to earn money. They devote their time to work. I see this point and absolutely
agree. I believe that people who work a lot will earn enough money. It is possibe to earn money before making a family, make savings and after this
start thinking about children. For example, the majority of my friends is
about 18-23 years old. All of them now thinking about a career, not about
familly. It does not mean that in future they will not have wives or husbands
and children. 
To sum up, I would like to say that in my opinion it is really more important
to work a lot and to be financial stable than have much free time for pleasure.

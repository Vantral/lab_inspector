Nowadays, a lot of buildings have their own purposes. Arhitects are trying create arts with useful features to make the people's lives better and easier, but they forget about the appereance. In my point of view, arhitects should think about quality of their arts too. They must care about purpose of buildigs and to look beautiful. 
The first argument is appereance. A lot of people walking on the streets see the buildings and than they has solved enter to it or not. In other words, the looking is a key to developing and producing. For example, not only one person do not go in hospital with bad look. Everyone start to think about treatment and qualification of doctors in this place. If we see the clear building with huge windows, new doors, beautiful garden. We want to visit the doctor in this hospital. 
The second argument is comfortable location. If arhitects want make the building successful they need care about where it will be. Everyone place has own purpose that is why location must connecting with it. For instance, museums are waorks of art. Arhitects need fint the place wchich was a convinient for people to visit. If it was located in the end of the city, nobody go to this building, even it will have a beautiful appereance. 
In conclusion, I would like to say buildings is the art which need to be useful for people. I disagree with the statement because arhitects should think about producing purposes and apperaence both. It helps the world become better.

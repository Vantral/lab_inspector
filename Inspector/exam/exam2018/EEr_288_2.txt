Nowadays in the information era there are people who think that the beauty of buildings is not as important as its practical usage. But I strongly disagree with this opinion. 
Today architects should think about the durability of buildings and they have to think only how to create an economical worthy construction which will be cheap and usefull. Both external and internal view of the building do not matter. A large number of people today tends to think that a beatiful building is a very expensive one. The materials now are not cheap. That is why it is more sensible to build a common nine-floor house without original ideas in its design. Creating an original building also needs a large amount of time to be spent on it. Many people think that the time does not worth the result. 
On the other hand, we live at the time when technologies have almost replaced the art. Today it is difficult to find people who are interested in architecture. Declining the idea that buildings should be both beatiful and useful we risk to live in a world where individuality would mean nothing. Every construction would be a right-shaped grey box with a lot of advantages in the way how the space is organised inside. In other words, it will serve its purpose but its view would be awful. I think that people should enjoy different piece of arts and especially architectural ones in order to feel and to live as people. 
Concluding, the difference between two points of view is connected with the economy and people feelings. Some people think that creating a beatiful building is expensive and long, some suggest that the beauty is worth the time and the money but it keeps us alive. I prefer to think that seeing a piece of art today is more important than saving money and time in order to build a construction without an original idea.

The percentage of energy from fossil fuels in China, USA, India, France and Sweden is presented on a line graph. It shows the changes of this percentage between 1970 and 2015. 
Firstly, it is important to mention a country in which during this period a constant growth can be noticed: it is India. India beginning from approximately 35% in 1975 reached 72% in 2015. China also showed a groth, however, not on the whole peroid. In 1970 it had 60% and in 2010 peaked at nearly 90%, but already in 2015 it's percentage fell to 85%. 
Secondly, the graph shows three countries, in which the percentage of energy was falling constantly. It is Sweden, France and United States. In 1970 these countries had 82%, 90% and 95% each, however, in 2015 Sweden and France reached the number of 25% and 48% each. USA lost 10% and the percentage of energy fell to the approximately 83%. 
As it can be seen, USA kept the percentage of energy from foccil fuels nearly on the same level for 45 years. It cannot be said about other countries, in which constant growth or constant fall can be noticed. France and Sweden reduced the percentage to the minimum numbers. China and India reached the highest percentage of energy from foccil fuels, however, China's number began to fall a couple of years ago.

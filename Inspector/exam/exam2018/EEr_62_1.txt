The bar chart indicates the proportions of obessed Canadian girls and boys from the middle of 1980s to the middle of 2000s while the table shows proportions of kids (of both genders) involved in regular physical activity for 2 years (1990 and 2005). In general, it can be seen that an overall number of overweight kids was increasing through the given time period. Additionally, more kids were doing exercise regularly in 2005 comparing to 1985. 
In 1985 and 1990 more girls were overweight (with a slight difference of 1-2 per cent), in 1995 the proportion of boys and the percentage of girls levelled off and were 16 per cent for each group. Then, for 2000 and 2005, in contrast, more boys were obessed with a difference of 1 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. In 2005 proportions of both overweighted boys and girls reached their maximums of 25 and 22 per cent respectively. Also, in 1990 the percentages of active boys and girls were almost equal and were just over a half while in 2005 the proportions increased significantly reaching 77 per cent for girls and 87 per cent for boys.

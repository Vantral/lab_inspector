The charts give an information about people of different age attending 3 types of courses in a UK college in 2012. 
Taking a closer look on the first chart, describing who attend science courses, we can see that there are 650 students in total and more than a half of members are 18-25 year olds (55%). The more older are the members the fewer part they take of the total number of this course members. People of age 26-40 take 30% of the total number and the rest 15% take people of 40 years old and above.

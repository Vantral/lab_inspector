As we living in a modern world, there is no one similar opinion on how people should spend their time. Some people think that it is better to earn money rather then have free time, others have the opposit view on this burningissue. In this essay we will discuss both opinions and at th end of the work I will provide my own one. 
On the one hand, earning more money can lead to the better living conditions and the level of life itself. There are different researces on this topic and the basic opinion is that earning more money motivates people in a sense of working hard, changing lifestyle and being the best version of yourself. Althought, more having money can open more opportunities for people to travel, educate themselves and so on. 
On the otherhand, many people still prefer to have more free time and not to earn more money. It can be explained by their desire to relax and spending time only on them. Furthermore, it is a common fact that people who are working a lot are mostly common to have stress, problems with sleep and health itself. In this case, those who are relaxing and having more free time are likely to have healthier lifestyle and be more optimistic. 
To sum it up, people might have different views on how they should live because of many reasons. It is their choice to earn more money and have more facilities and opportunities or to have more free time and spend it on relaxing. To my mind, it is much better to work a lot and have more money, because it opens a wide range of things to try in life.

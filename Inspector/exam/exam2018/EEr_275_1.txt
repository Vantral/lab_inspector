According to the first pie chart, science courses were attended mostly by the 18-25 years olds persons whose figure reached 55 % of the total number (650 students). The second place was occupied by 26-40 year olds people; their figure accounted 30 %. The rest 15 % who learned this course were persons whose age was 40 years old or above. 
In contrast, at the second pie chart we can see that arts courses were the most popular among this oldest category:their figure was 45 %, while the proportion of 18-25 and 26-40 year olds was approximately the same and accounted for around 30% of the total (600 students). 
As it may be evident from the third pie chart, sports and health courses were attended first and foremost by 26-40 year olds persons whose number reached 62 %. The figures for two rest categories were circa 20 %. 
All in all, it can be concluded that in a UK college science courses were popular among the youngest category, the oldest category chose arts courses and 26-40 year olds persons were interested in sports and health courses.

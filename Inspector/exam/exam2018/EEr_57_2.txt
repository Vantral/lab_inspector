In the contemporary world there are over 7.5 billions people and some emphasize that it is impossible to help everyone and governments should pay attention only on people that are living in their countries. I partly agree with this statement. Let us discuss this issue in more details. 
On the one hand, in any country there are a lot of citizens that need a help. Diverse help: residences,because not all people have own house or flat; expensive medical drugs since some suffer from different deseases: cancer, diabetes, insomnia and others; there are a lot of orphens or children, living with parents-alcoholics and the government must help them. It should invest more money to this issues and it is not right to do focus on other nations while in your country there are many suchproblems. 
On the other hand, there are some situations when only union of countries can solve the problem. For example, natural disasters: flood or earthquake. When these situations happen in one country, others begin to help one, to send the first aid, for example, because one cannot fix the situation itself. We know also the situations when the terracts or civil wars were happened in one country. In these cases other nations should help this country or it will suffer a lot. 
To sum up, I would like to say that, in general, governments should focus on their countries, but there are such cases when it very necessary to pay attention on other nations and help them.

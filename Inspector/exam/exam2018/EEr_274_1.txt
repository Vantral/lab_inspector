The charts illustrates the proposition of different age groups attending 3 courses in a UK college in 2012. 
As we can see from the graph, science courses are the most popular among all, although all the courses have more than 600 participants. Science courses reached their peak at 55 per cent with 18-25 year olds, but people who attend the arts courses at the same age has only 30 per cent of all. It seems that grown-up persons are more into science rather arts. If we look at the sports and health courses, we will see that the youngest age from the graphs are not fond of health carring and the percentage of attendance dropped to only 15 per cent. However, in this graph the group of 26-50 year olds reached their highest peak of interest. It has an enormous 62 %. Despite all the courses the most comfortable for older people (40 years and above) are arts courses. Its percent of attandance went up to 45 % in there.

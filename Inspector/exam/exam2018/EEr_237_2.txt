Some people prefer to earn more money and have less free time. Others prefer to have more free time and less money. 
With increased quantity of workplaces, people have a wealth of various types of opportunities. People strive to work a lot in order to open a great boundary of other choices and career "ladder". 
To begin with that with techonolical progress our chances to find a work are boundless. Unfortunately, it requires a lot of time to achieve success in a carrer and to get a pleasure in one's free time, in other words, to relax from everyone. Actually, I agree with this opinion that people prefer getting a high salary rather than to spend one's time with a family or in the circle of close friends. To support this idea, I will give an arguent to this. I have an uncle who works day to day because he is keen of working and considers the life to be worth only then when a person makes a lot. Admittedly, he does not relax except sleeping 4-5 hours at night in his life. The most essential thing is that he is fond of completeing his duties and responsibilities. 
The second argument is aboot many prominent people who work for the sake of art and culture, For instance a large number of actors, arts, musucians do their work well despite of anxiety, exhaustion and so on. They live for art. It sounds weird but i am sure that such people's labour does not depend on their salaries as their primary principle is to continue to make the world better. In the wake of their stubborn pesonalities our lives improve, otherwise. 
To conclude, i would like to emphasize that indeed people try to more money instead of spending leisure. Because these people have
an end.

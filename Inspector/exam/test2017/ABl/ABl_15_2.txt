There is point of view, that musicians and film producers suffer from pirate copping of songs and films, so they lose a lot of money. For some people downloading music and films is a theft, which must be punished. 
On the one hand it is a really problem, because people always download music and films free for a long time. The film or composition was done in 1990 year, for example, but people are listening it free for latest years. Musicians and producers involve a lot of money for their compositions, so they need to make money again by selling films or music disks in special shops. The main role plays own rights and rights of property. Musician or producer makes imaghines. some interesting film or beautiful music, so it is his mind and he must be given money. And people who take it from author without permission really make theft. 
On the other hand musicians and producers make money from concerts and seeing films in the cinema, so they have enough money for pleasent and comfortable surviving. The music and films were free in the internet for a long time, so now people really cannot imagine life without it. Seeing films and listening music is a good chance to improve your shills or mind. For example some russian people like to see original english or french films because of studying languages. Another argument is that buying all new films or music disk is too expensive. There are a lot of new films and some people have not money to buy it. For example poor people or children, who are without parents and have no money to do it. But they may download some films or music or watch it on-line in the internet. For this mind free films are not a theft, because it helps to develop people's mind. 
It is likely to think for people that free music and films in the internet is a better way than buy it. For this opinion downloading of illigal copies should not be punished because of it help and pleasant influence for people's lifes.

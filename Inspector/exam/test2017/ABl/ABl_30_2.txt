International community regularly rises the question - what should we do to struggle against illegal pirate copying sucessfully? Musicians and film producers have huge loses every year. How can we prevent such situations in future? 
From one point of view widespread of music and films illegally shouldn't be stopped. Popular musicians get money from tours around the world: if millions of people like your music, songs, performances, they will buy ticket on the concert. Practise shows that mostly unpopular singers relates negatively to illegal widespread of their songs, so they don't have another source of getting money, because their concerts are badly organized and no one buy tickets. Creations of talanted musicians should be acceptable for people of all nations, strates, equally for rich and poor, that's why they must be free. 
The opposition of mentioned point of view says that all high-qualified goods must be payed. The world market of films and songs lost huge amounts of money and even laws can't stop the process of widespread. People, who take this point of view, put on various restrictions. For example, it is supposed that Internet websites, which accept music, films or other materials, should make all accounts for visitors not free. If you often visit cinemaparks, you can notice that there are a lot of cameras in a hall, where films are watched. That way officials want to stop activity of cameramen, who take a copy of film in the cinema and download to websites for a payment. 
To sum up, the process of widespread can be stopped, however, musicians, writers or other creative people can attract by the quality of creations. So, if songs are popular, people will visit concert even for a big ticket price. If film is breath-taking and unusual, unique, people will come to cinema to watch a masterpiece on a big screne.

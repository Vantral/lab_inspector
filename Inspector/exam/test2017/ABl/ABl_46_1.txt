The graph provides information about changes in amount of unemployed people in different regions of our planet and whole world. 
On the top of rate we can see North Africa, where unemployment get close to 13%. There is no changes between 2014 and 2015 years for this region. At the same time the amount of people who can't get job decreases in Middle East. It falls down for 2,4 points to 9,6. Thats the biggest success in solving this problem in the world. According to the chart, while unemployment is falling in ME, it grows up in EU, where this rate is still bigger than worldwide. Actually, now there are only two regions on the graph, where the unemployment rate is lower than world's average rate. The most scarifying thing is we even can't say about falling trend: the result in Middle East could be explained with just migration of unemployed workers to EU, where as was told, the graph's rate grown up.

Copying and sharing music or films on the internet is the issue that is very popular nowadays. Some people hold a view that people doing it should be punished while others do not support them. From my point of view, the second position is right. 
First of all, there is the fact, that some people, for example, children or teenagers cannot afford to buy music albums or films to themselves. Therefore, they do not have chance to listen or watch it. What is more, musicians and film producers can loose money not from illegal pirate copies but from the situation when people will not know about them. This is actually about musicians and producers that are at the begining of their career. They need to use all possible channels to become more popular and the lack of access will not let them to do it. 
However, there are some problems with illegal copying. The first one is that popular film makers and musicians do not get all the income they can. Therefore, the cannot make new films or music because they are lack of money. The second one is that sometimes they do not understand how popular they really are as there is no evidance or statics about people downloading it. 
These problems can be actually solved. As a solution producers and musicians can allow to download some of their products for free and ask money for some other. What is about the second problem, to my mind, it can be solved in connection with the first one. People will listen or watch films for free and want to buy some else. 
To sum up, illegal copying and sharing music and films is not such a big crime for that people should be punished in some way.

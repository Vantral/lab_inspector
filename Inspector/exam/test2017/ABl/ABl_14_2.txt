Musicians and filmmakers lose a lot of money every year because of pirate industry. The problem is it it is the theft and be punished or not. 
I, personally, think that copying and sharing music or films on the internet is kind of theft. Firstly, all people need to protect law and be under it, the modern rules of author's rights try to stop it (copying and sharing), that is why people who copy films and music are thefts. Secondly, musicians and film producers spent a lot of money and time to make their films and audios, and when they do not have money from using it by other people it is dishonesty. Thirdly, people who copy and share films and old music made it only for money, it looks like theft from you house in order to sell it on the black market. 
But, there is opposite opinion, that copying and sharing are not theft. To begin with, people who copy and share films and audios are like Robin Hoods of modern world, because usually producers and musicians are rich, and they do not lose a lot while their audios and movies sent to internet, but poor people could use it. Moreover, the internet is a free "opposite" world where not all laws are acting, there is a free information about everything in the world there and music and films are also should be free. 
In conclusion, I would like to say, that despite two opposite oppinions the position of people who say that copying and sharing is the theft is more clear because in order to live in free society, with opportunity to have affair wages you need to be under the law, and law said, that it is kind of foul.

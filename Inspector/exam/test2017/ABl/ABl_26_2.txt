The problem of high popularity of pirate content appeared not so long ago but everyone has to deal with it in the postmodern era. There is still no universal answer for this question. 
I do believe that illegal connection to the pirate content should be punished. Firstly, copying and sharing pirate copies undermine the right of intellectual ownership. It leads to money loss and a violation of basic right to have a property. The situation goes even worse if we will not forget the fact that such types of content (music and films) are produced directly by the authors. Secondly, due to the high popularity of illegal content then is a reduction of investitions in the music and films productions. Every project needs to be financed properly and there is no exception. It is highly unlikely to create something special if there will not a necessary material base Tonit. Thirdly, consumers should pay for music and films because there is a strong point in the understanding of a connection between a spending of your own money and consuming goods. There is no debate in the society whether people should pay for air tickets or not. Music and films are not usually associated with classic private goods and it has to be changed. 
To summarize, there some somewhat strong arguments to the punishment of law violators. These actions are unjust, selfish and ineffective. They may lead to dramatic reduction of content's quality. That would be a huge pity and a loss-loss situation.

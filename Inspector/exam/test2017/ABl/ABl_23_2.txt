It is not a secret that producing pirate copies has become a huge problem for musicians and producers as they lose so much money because of this. A lot of people use this opportunity not to pay. Some people believe that such dishonest people should be punished whereas others suggest that they just act rationally. 
It seems that there is a real rational part in this kind of behaviour. Because of full access to this sort of information, which people are usually interested in, they sometimes do not have any thoughts about illegal side of what they are doing. They believe that they just download a song, when it can be called committing a crime, judging by the law. That is the reason why these people should not be punished. Their aim is not connected with illegal actions at all. 
From the other point of view, we can come up with the decision that people who leak such information are criminals as their main purpose is not download a film and spend their evening sitting on a sofa watching it and just having a good time. They do release music and video and help them to be spread. They hack special services and steal the content. Maybe this is a kind of some strike, as these hackers believe that if they have an opportunity to get music and video for free because of skills, they also can spread it and help other people not to pay. 
Anyway people are more likely to watch and listen to pirate copies for entertainment. They do not really care about the law, when downloading a film. It is more a problem of education as we do not realise that our actions are illegal in these moments and we should be better taught to feel more sure about things we are doing to keep safe. 
To sum it all up, it is necessary to say that it really depends, while talking about punishment. It can be a good idea to become more strict, but, firstly, people should become informed about illegal part of these actions.

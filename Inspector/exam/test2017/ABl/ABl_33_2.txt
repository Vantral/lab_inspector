Nowadays there are a lot of types of intertainment that we can get from the Internet. Free films and music are only two of them. At the era of the fast Internet we can share different files almost without any limits. Due to this, the problem of illegal copying is arising today. 
Some people think that spreading music albums and films on the Internet must be recognised as a crime, and people who has committed that should be gone on trial. As for me, I totally agree with their position. 
Firstly, any film, song or any other piece of art is author's property. This means that, for example, only director can decide to whom he would sell or demonstrate his film. Copying this property is unacceptable. In modern democratic countries the power of law should protect the right of self-property and punish those who violate the law. Moreover, it can be recognised as stealing money and labour from artists which is also illegal. 
Secondly, copying and sharing music and films fo free can have a bad influence on the economy growth. Intertaining business, which includes films and music, is usually a huge part of country's income (for example, the USA). So, if you steel films and songs, it is equal if you steel products and create a kind of "black" or "shade" market on the Internet. The economy suffers a lot due to illegal transactions because it looses masses of money and product turnover. 
All in all, any type of steeling should be forbidden in modern countries. Copying and sharing music and films on the Internet is definitely a theft and have to be punished. Today Nobody doubts that money stealing is a crime and that you are not allowed to take someone's property without paying for it. So why should we let internet thefs commit their crimes and more? I strongly believe that there is no reasons for that.

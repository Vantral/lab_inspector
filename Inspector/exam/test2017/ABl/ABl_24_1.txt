The chart shows the level of unemployment in six regions in the period from 2014 to 2015. 
There are N. Africa, Middle East, European Union, Latin America, S. Asia and other parts of the world on that graph. One can see that 2 regions, N. Africa and Middle East, have the highest unemployment rate comparing to other regions given on this chart. 
Now, let's look at the chart in a little bit more details. First of all, there is a "leader" in unemployment rate: N. Africa that has the same rate for both 2014 and 2015. The second place is occypied by Middle East, but this region decreased its unemployment rate on 1,4%. The other regions (except S. Asia) have quite the same rate in range from 5,8 to 7,9. In addition, it is needed to say that S. Asia have the lowest unemployment rate among given regions in the period from 2014 to 2015. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that the chart illustrates 3 types of changes: growth, decline and no change at all.

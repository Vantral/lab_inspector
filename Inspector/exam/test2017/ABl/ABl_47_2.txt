One of the widely discussed issues nowaday is question about illeagal content in the Internet, partly films and music. It is undenaible that it has some controversial aspects. I agree, with this statement, that nowadays such actions as download pirate copies should be punished. 
Firstly, it is not unfair and unrespectfully tp get some products without paying some fee. Musicians, producers and others people of art do their own job and should be paid for it. these represents of such work spend their time to create really important and beatiful things in our world. So, we, listeners, viwer and so one show respect their work and help in their ways. Last but not the least, todays world is world of money where the smallest jod is paid. No one want to get nothing for time, brain power which were using for creation something new. Why we shouldn't pay for film or song? We really should to do this. Because fees could be used to help poor people in Africa, or, maybe, to create the new film or song. 
In this way, I would like to say that in our modern society and word people should respect each others and their works. One the thinks which help we can express our feeling is to pay some amount of money for thankful and help in future development. Buying illegal pirate copies we encourage those, who are the crimes and with these actions we make our society more badly and give an awful example for our children and descendants.

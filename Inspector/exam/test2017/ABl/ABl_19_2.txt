It's evident nowadays that there is a big problem on the media market. Also it's important to understand that it's quite complicated to be aware of all transactions that happen on day-to-day basis in the sphere of buying and selling music and films. But some people think that everyone should respect the author's piece of art and to legally buy it as they buy food or clothes. Others claim that the Internet is the place where you can get all the media stuff you want without paying for it because everyone does exactly the same thing. 
To my mind, it's fair and morally justificated to pay for someone's else work no matter what type of work you're dealing with. Firstly, it takes a lot of time for musicians and film producers to create the peace of art. They do a lot of work, spend money on the making process and advertisment, try to understand their audience. Secondly, intellectual property is protected by the law and everyone who doesn't follow the judiciary system's rules should be punished. Thirdly, it's really important to protect the unique feature of musical and film industries when only the ones who are ready to pay for access to an art should take this opportunity. 
However, some people assume that everyone should get an access to films and music because it's impossible to destroy the market of pirate copies and in this case all the limitations don't make sense. I totally disagree with this point of view because there is an improvement of law system and the system of market's control and the amount of pirate copies decreases. 
All things considered, I totally believe that musicians and film producers should get the whole amount of money for their work and everyone who ignores the law of intellectual property should be punished.

Modern people are connected with cities and their infrastructure on daily basis. One of the most important features of the cities is their buildings. Some people think that housing should achieve only one goal, be practical and beneficial. Others believe that buildings should be also beautiful. I am agree with the second statement. 
Firstly, let us concider that every building in our country has become the same. However, they all have their own goals. The common image of the houses will lead that newcomers or people with geografical critinism will be unable to orientate in the city. The example of this situation we can find in well-known film "The Irony of Destany" when the hero got lost in the city that had the same image as his native one. So, the architactural look of the building is vital. 
Secondly, the art of the bulidings gives people happiness and provides with the sense of beauty. The cities that are famouse for their architectural brighteness attract a lot of people every year for visiting. And the answer is that they are beautiful and unique. There are a lot of examples how artists or writers were inspired by the portrials of the cities. All in all, urban architecture should be awe-inspiring. 
However, some people are sure that there is no use in bulding masterpices. All sources of builders should be directed to the proper constructing and planing of the house. It should play only practical role. So, hospitals, schools, police offices, gvermant buildings should be just convinient for use and are not required in often repearings. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that I can more agree to the point that building should not only be beneficial but also be beautiful and brings people the inspiration and beauty.

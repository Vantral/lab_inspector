The pie charts provide the information on the age of students in different courses in one college located in the UK in the year of 2012. 
From the pie chart done on science cources it is seen that more than half of all the students are quite young (in the age group of 18-25 year olds).30% of the students are from 26 to 40 years old and only 15% were 40 years and above. The pie chart illustrating art courses shows a tendency of an age group of 40 years old and above to attend art classes (45%). The percentage of 18-25 years old and 26-40 years old is approximately the same. It proves the fact that people older than 40 tend to be more interested in Art than other age groups. We can also see that Art courses are in general not that popular as the amount of student lowers in comparison with science courses (600 students in art courses and 650 in the science courses). However, the pie chart that provides data on Sports and Health courses tells us that most of all 26-40 years olds are interested in these subjects as their percentage is 62%. Least interested in Sports and Health are 18-25 years olds.

We are given two pie charts that represent information about the main purposes of using public libraries in the UK in 1990 and 2000. Overall, on both charts it is seen that the vast majority of visitors borrowed or returned books. 
Looking at these pie charts more attentively, we can observe some substantial differences. For example, in 2000 the smallest percentage of visitors (only 2 per cent) used libraries to study, while in 1999 studying made up 1o per cent, as well as reading newspapers or magazines. Another difference is that in the second chart we can notice an increase in numper of people who used libraries to find information (20 per cent). However, these charts still have something in common. For instance, almost a quarter of each chart represents a percentage of people who borrowed DVDs (15 per cent and 18 per cent). So, that these figures are rather similar. 
On the whole, these two pie charts show the most common reasons for using libraries, where the biggest segment singles out the fact that people were prone to borrow and return books.

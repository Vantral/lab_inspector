There are arguments in architecture and some people claim that any building not necessarily should be an eye-catching piece of art and better serve its aims, so architects do not need to care about how their projects look like. 
From one hand, the idea that building should serve it aims is not view. It is obvious that everything is built for a particular reason - every house, shopping centre, school, medical centre are built because people need them to maintain life, comfort and stability, problem solving. If any building is not appropriate for people's development than it causes problems. Architects should firstly think about how useful any building should be, and I strongly agree with this point of view. 
From the other hand, if the building is ugly and boring, it causes problem too, especially when there are a huge amount of them in one particular space. Poorly designed houses and buildings are affecting people's mood and in the long-term perspective can cause a depression and a decrease of level of happiness and stability. As a result of it, the crime level may increase. So, there is no doubt that architects should care about the appearance of every building too. 
In conclusion I want to say that I strongly agree with the idea that buildings must serve its purposes, but in my own opinion the balance should be everywhere. More than useful and at least a little bit beautiful - that is how ideal building should look like.

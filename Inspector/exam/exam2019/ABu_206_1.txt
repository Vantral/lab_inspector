The charts below represent the quantity of male and female workers in the two countries which are Indonesia and Australia in three employment domains. The first outstanding thing is that women are not likely to get involved in the sphere of industry and appear to work there much less than men (8 versus 15 in Indonesia and 11 versus 32 in Australia. 
As for Australia, it is remarkable that male workers are more likely to get employed in any domain, the exeption is agriculture where the men are just 29 per cent versus 43 per cent for women. On the whole, the agriculture is not htat developped in Australia rather than in Indonesia. In the industry male workers are more frequently met in both countries and their quantity is more over 2 times in Indonesia and almost three times in Australia. The amount of all the workers remains the same in Australia and Indonesia. In the first country the number of male workers in services slightly differs from the one that describes the female workers (it is only 56 versus 49) In Australia the level of industry and sevices is much higher than in Indonesia and the numbers of employees differs drammatically. Thus female workers in Australia do the job in services and industry more frequently than in Australia. 
Taking in consideration that agriculture is almost in stagnation in Australia the male workers are only 3 versus 29 in Indonesia and there is no more than only one female worker in that very sphere in Australia which is quite an interesting data.

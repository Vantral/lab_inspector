The bar chart and the table provide data about the number of overweight young people in Canada from 1990 to 2005 and the percentage of youngers who regularly did sports in 1990 and 2005. 
From the bar chart we can see that the amount of overweigh boys and girls was growing during all this time. It increased dramatically in the period from 1995 to 2000, which made up 16% in 1995 and about 20% in 2000. Moreover, the percentage of young people just continued to rise up to 2005, which constituted 22% of girls and 25% of boys. 
Turning to the table, it is clearly seen that the portion of young people who did regular exercise was increasing up to 2005, just like the number of overweight people. It constituted only 51% of girls and 57% of boys in 1990, but in 2005 it made up 77% of girls and 87% of boys. Therefore, the number of boys remained higher but the common figure changed. 
The bar chart and the table indicated that there were more young people who did regular physical activity in Canada from 1990 to 2005 than those who were overweight.

Nowadays a huge amount of scientific research are sponsored by the private organisations rather than by governments. There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of this aspect. I would like to discuss both of them. 
The private organisations today are more likely to become a sponsor of some scientific project. People, interested in science sometimes donate their money to such companies. It is a nice chance to support young scientists, for example and make a big step to the future. Moreover, private companies may be international, while governments should spend only their own country's money, which is more expencive. For example, people from all over the world can be sponsors for scentific projest they like, and this is very important, as for me. I am sure that the science should be international. 
But there are some disadvantages also. For example, not all of the private companies are fair. The donated money may be spent for another features, and people, who donate money will be blamed. Another disadvantage is that the scientific research, sponsored by private organisation, may be not sucessful. It is more likely for the project when it is paid by private company, unfortunetaly. Also, not huge amount of people would like to spend their money for science research becouse not everyoune thinks that it is important. 
For the conclusion, I would like to say, that there are a lot of both advantages and disadvantages in sponsoring scientific research by private companies. 
But I am sure that it will help the science flourish. Private organisations should exist because of their huge help in collecting money.

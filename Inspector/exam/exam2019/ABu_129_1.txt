The pie charts provide the data on the deployment of public libraries in the United Kingdom in 1990 and 2000 with the number of visits being 350 million in 1990 and 290 million ten years later. Generally, the main aim of the vast majority of visitors - more than a half - was to take or give books back. 
In 1990 the second most popular reason to come to the library in the UK was to read newspapers or journals (15%), whereas in 2000 it constituted only a tiny fraction of the chart. Similarly, while in 1990 studying as a purpose accounted for one tenth of the overall percentage, a decade later it dropped dramatically, being the smallest part of the whole chart. However, the number of visitors seeking for information doubled in a ten-year period. Also, in 2000 a new aim to visit libraries occured: nearly one fifth of comers wanted to borrow or return DVDs.

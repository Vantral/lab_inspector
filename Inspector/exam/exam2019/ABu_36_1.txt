The bar chart and the table presented demonstrate the percentage of young children of both genders who were considered to be overweight over two decades and those who exercised on a regular basis in 1990 and 2005. The most striking feature is a steady increase of the number of girls and boys with obesity and physically active children. 
There are a few trends that draw attention in the bar chart. One of them is the prevalence of boys with weight issues over the girls with the same problem in recent years. On the contrary, in 1985 and 1990 there were slightly more overweight girls than such boys. Moreover, in 1995 the amount of children of female and male gender with exceeding weight was equal. 
Eye-catching tendencies in the table include the rise of the percentage of the children who were prone to do fitness activities from 51% in 1990 to 77% in 2005 among girls and from 57% in 1990 to 87% in 2005 among boys. Also, overall number of active young ones was not equal: there were slightly more boys than girls in 1990 as well as in 2005.

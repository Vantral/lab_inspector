The given pie charts provide data about the main reasons of visits of public libraries in the UK in 1900 and 2000 respectively. 
In the first chart we can see that the main reason - borrowing and returning books constitutes more than half of the pie chart, about 65%. The second position is reading magazines and newspapers - 15%. The other two reasons - studying and finding information both make up to 10% each. Now turning to the next chart, borrowing and returning books make up to 55%. Finding information - 20%, takes the second place. In addition, there is a new purpose in 2000 for people to visit libraries that is - borrowing and returning DVDs, which constitutes 18%. A tiny fraction of the pie chart - 2% is covered by the people who come here to study. 
Comparing the pie charts, we can see that borrowing and returning books has remained the most popular reasons to visit libraries both in 1990 and 2000. A new purpose has evolved in 2000 - borrowing and returning DVDs. The number of people who come to study in a library has fallen dramatically from 1990 to 2000.

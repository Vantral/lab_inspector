Three presented pie charts illustrate the percentage of various age groups taking part in science courses, arts courses as well as sports and health courses in the UK in 2012. Overall, the number of total students in the courses is different and so are the trends which can be seen in these pie charts. Each pie chart has its own the majority and minority group. 
The first chart is dedicated to science courses and has 650 students in general. It can be clearly seen that more than a half of students who attend this course are 18-25 years old (55%). The percentage of students whose age is between 26 and 40 years old make up to 30% from the total number. Only 15% of people who are 40+ attend this course and this is the least populat age group at these courses. 
The second pie chart has the least total number of students (600) attending arts courses. The majority group includes people who are 40+ years old and counts as 45% from the total number of students. Students who are 18-25 and 26-40 years old have approximately the same figures and count as 30% and 25% relevantly. 
The last chart includes statistics about people who attend sports and health courses. More than a half of 630 students (62%) are 26-40 year olds, whereas 18-25 year olds take the last position (15%). Students who are 40+ years old present only 23% from the total number of students.

The given bar chart and table provide information about obesity in both genders in Canada from 1990 and 2005 and the percentage of them that did physical activities regularly. 
Overall, it can be seen from the given data that boys tend to be more overweigh than girls as well as more active. 
However, at the beginning of the period both genders were practically at the same positions of obesity. In 1990 there was a decline among young boys that covered only 12% during 5 years. In 1995, however, the amount of overweight people was at the equal position. The number of obese boys started to grow only in 2000 and reached its peak of 25 pecent only by the end of the whole period. The table that describes the amount of boys and girls that do sport regularly shows a different trend. Boys were more active than girls, by the beginning of the period in 6 percents. However, by the end of the researched period there was a dramatic rise for girls that do exercises, while for boys the growth was less considerable.

The chart and table provide us with the information about the statistic data about boys and girls, who suffer from obeysity, and thous, who did regular physical exercises from 1985 till 2005. 
Observing the chart, we can indicate the tendency of growth among the number of overweight teenagers. Albeit, till the 1995 year there were more girls with overweight, the number of them became equal wit the number of boys in this year(16%). After that, the percentage of boys with obeysity outweighted the girls. It took its highest position at the mark of 25%. 
The table also shows us the tendency to rise, but among the boys and girls who has regular physical exercises. From the 1990 till the 2005 year, the percent of girls, who do exercises encrease from 51% to 77%, and the percent of boys from 57% to 87%. Thus, the boys kept their leadership there. 
Summuraising all of the above, I should note, that, regardless the fact of growing popularity of sport, the number of thous, who suffer from outweight also rises.

In modern world the issue of time and money is widely discussed by many people. Some of them prefer to have a lot of money and spend practically all the time for job, while others prefer to have a lot of free time and less money. 
People who have a lot of money are successful in many spheres. For example, they can travell a lot, they can buy expensive goods of high quality, they can eat in expensive restaurants. Money is an energy that allows people to fell free and confident, but what is the price of being reach? Obviously, it is necessary to work a lot. As a consecuence, stress and tiredness are possible. Moreover, there is no free time for family, friends, hobby and personal interests. 
On the other hand, people who prefer having free time more than having money can seem to be more happy than those who are reach. They are more relaxed because they do not need to think about their business and documents, they do not suffer from stress and it is easier for them to maintain the contact with their close people because they have enough time for it. They are happy with such things as good relationships and true friends. For them happines is available without money. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that it is essential to maintain the balance between these two ways of life. Money is very important part of our life which allows us to feel confident, but free time is also necessary for everybody because it is a chance to relax and to spend time with ourselves.

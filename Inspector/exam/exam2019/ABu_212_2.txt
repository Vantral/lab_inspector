In the century of globalisation and constant economical development people pay much more attention to their career and financial conditions. There are a big number of people that choose job instead of their free time because of financial motivation. But there is also another group of people who see the importance of having free time and neglect the seriousness of earning money. In this essay both these views will be discussed. 
The first opinion can be understood and people who follow this idea can be regarded as those who take care of their future and looking straight forward. What is more, a person of such views can be described as hard-working, well-educated person which can achieve his or her career goals easily. Moreover, it should be noted that all people need money to exist and communicate with society somehow and undoubtely almost everyone would rather prefer to have money as much as possible. 
Surely, some people think differently and have an opposite point of view. This type if person sees true value in possibility of doing what you want to avoiding strong time frameworks which are appearing when a person has a high-paid prestigious job. Thus, they believe that money is only a tool which can be used but not the terminal goal. To my mind, this statement doesn't mean that these people don't realise the importance of having enough money, it means that they just can see balance in time and money correlation. 
To sum it up, I would add that I agree with the second statement and I consider money a tool which is really helpful, but I deffinetly wouldn't make it the highest aim of my life.

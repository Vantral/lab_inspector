Undoubtedly, in our on-going world the issue of money versus time is currently raising its population among people of all social classes. Some thrive for more spare minutes to live, whereas some incline to being more financially successful regardless of free time to sacrifice. Which path is better? This essay is going to examine and elaborate both of the choices to make. 
Firstly, let the focus be put on the financial priority. In order to achieve economical stability and really pleasing income later on a person needs to devote all his or her forces to work. It is not something common like patiently sitting in the office 8 hours per day. It is about exactly realizing and fulfilling the responsibilities, following the rules of the company, recognising their relevance and, finally, establishing personal vision of things. These and some more processes are highly demanding in emotional perspective, first of all. In other words, to succeed, you have to invvest your energy in non-stop brainstroming and decision making which will for sure leave practically no time for leisure and self. 
Facing the opposite choice which outlines time as the most precious value, it is obvious that a person should possess a certain view to take this option. There are people who are ready to reject not only money but all the facilities and conviniencies suggested by modern civilization. Usually such distinguished people are monks who prefer to make an input into their mental development rather than into banks accounts. They do not work as we are used to and devote all their time to prays and integrating into nature. 
In conclusion, I would like to depict my own opinion. Actually, I am somewhere between those two. To choose between money and time is a big deal and one should carefully approach this queation. Simply put, time is the real cost of money, and everyone should remember that.

There are two pie charts, showing the usage of public libraries in the United Kingdom in two years: 1990 and 2000. 
As it can be seen from the pie charts, the main reason to visit public libraries is to borrow or return books (65% for 1990 and 55% for 2000). Also, there is a new reason for visits in 2000, it is borrowing or returning DVDs. Moreover, total visits in 2000 decrease (from 350 million people in 1990 to 290 million people in 2000). 
The pie charts also show that the percentage of people, who visit the library for studying in 1990 is 10%, while the percentage of these people in 2000 is 2%, which is five times less. Moreover, percentage of people, who use public libraries for finding the information in 2000 is two times bigger then in 1990, but percentage of people, who visit public libraries for reading newspapers or magazines become smaller in three times in 2000.

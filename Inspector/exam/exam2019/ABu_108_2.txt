In the recent years governments had to step back and offer the spot of those who conduct and cover the costs of most of the scientific research to private companies. While there is a number of advantages to it, there is also a fair amount of downsides. 
The most pivotal upside to private companies both paying for and carrying out the scientific research lies in the fact that the competition on the market forces the companies to be more responsible with their approaches to work. The money and time spent are those of the workers of the organisations, therefore, it is prudent for them to know how to use the resources with maximum benefts. 
One other major advantage is that the range of topics on which the research is conducted is indisputably broader. The goverments often fund only those studies that have a military application, while private companies might broaden those horizons and become interested in anything that has a potential to become profitable. 
Nevertheless, there is a clear disadvantage of such a situation as well. The desperation borne out of the fierce competition between companies and the race for quicker positive results might force the companies to refuse to disclose full information and even rig the results. For instance, this is especially prevalent for the health industry, in which oftentimes a number of trials with adverse side-effects are not made public. 
To conclude, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages: the researches might have to be double-checked for validity, however, they are more efficiently conducted and are of a wider variety.

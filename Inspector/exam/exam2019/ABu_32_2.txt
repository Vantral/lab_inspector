Nowadays we live in the world where communication plays a primary role. Good relationships betweeen governments always lead to success and peace. It is important to pay attention and help people of our own country. However, I strongly disagree with the statement that governments should only focus on their country because if people will start to ignore their neighboors and don't communicate with them it can bring us to war and chaos. 
First of all, there are several reasons why countries should help each other. One of them is it's always good to have a civilian in case your country will get in troble some day. As long as you support another country, your government has a right to ask for their help too. 
Secondly, if your contry in a good relationships with neighboor governments you can manage trade issues together. So that your country would have products not only made in your own government. 
Of course, it is very significant to help people in your own country. Moreover, I beleive that you will never manage good relationships with other countries, unless your government will be stable and people will be happy to live in this country. In order to do this, governments should not forget about simple needs of their citizens and try to do their best for the happy living. 
To conclude, I would like to say that it is more than possible to help all people, it is even more than needed to help if you have a power to do it. In my opinion everything good you do to other people will return back, that's why I don't see reasons for not supporting other countries and focusing only on your own.

The figures provide data on the main purposes of visiting public libraries during the period from 1990 to 2000.

Remarkably, there appeared new aims of visiting public libraries in 2000, such us reading journals. It also became popular to borrow and return DVDs. It is interesting than in 2000 the number of visitors deploying libraries as a source of information halved in comparison with 1999 and costituded a quarter of the total percentage. What is more, while in 1990 the share of those using libraries for study and finding information was equal, in 2000 there was a significant gap between these figures.

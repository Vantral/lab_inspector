Nowadays buildings play a crucial part in the view of the city. Some people believe that amazing and extraordinary constructions reflect city and its culture in general. However, there is an opinion that architects should not pay much attention on the construction's view because it is more important to build something that will follow building's purpose. Personally, i truly believe that it is a very controversial issue. 
On the one hand, architects should take the safetiness of the construction on the first place. It is not a secret that there are some materials, for example, glass which looks fascinating. However, it may become a dangerous material if an architect decides to create a huge business skyscraper only following his/her aesthetic point of view. 
On the other hand, modern technologies are improving extremely fast these days and architects can both build comfortable for using constructions and make them breathtaking and gorgeous. It used to say that there is no need to divide the main cause why do people need a new construction and why don't proffesionals make it as a work of art. 
In my point of view, architects should also pay attention on the building's look as it reflects the aesthetic part of our culture. Moreover, with such opportunities which we are provided it is not a problem to create both stunning and comfortable constructions which could turn into the works of art. 
In conclusion, it is always important to remember that buildings take a huge part in the reflection of the city and country and it can also represent our culture so with all modern technologies architects can easily create buildings which can be both useful and gorgeous.

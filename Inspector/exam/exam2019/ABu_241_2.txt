The development of children is one of the most crusial thinks as well as the hardest one. It is often argued that family is influence you the most in the childhood. However, there are some people who strongly believe that such places as school and hobby groups are played the most important part in your life On the one hand, from the first day of your birth you are togeter with your family members. That has a very profound effect indeed for all aspects of your life. For instance, sientific researsh had shown that we become similar with our parents and siblings in first several years because of a great contact with them. Moreover, child who do not have parents is found to have similarities with people around them. 
On the other hand, a great amount of time we spend outdoors. Such place as school plays such an inportant part in so many people's lives that we cannot underestimate that. In our day and age, more and more children have problems with their parents and school teachers and classmates help them to tackle that problems in some way. For example, teaches spend a lot of time with children and the have an opportunity to notice the problem even if child did not tell anything. That is because teachers have a physological education and they can understand children better then their parents. 
I strongly believe that family likewise outside places play one of the biggest parts in the development of children's charecter. In the childhood we learn many things from the nearest to us people so it is important to take the greatest knowledges from both, family and school.

Twenty first century is considered to be a very productive era with a lot of people involed in the working process with the money earning as a main goal. Many people argue either it is better to earn a better living, spending the most part of time at work or it is better to have more leisure time without such a big amount of money. In this eaasy we will discuss both opinions. 
On the one hand, money has a huge impact on the quality of human life. Money can give an opportunity to have a better living, good appartment, own transport, can afford a sense of satisfaction and self-pleasure. As an example we can take a businessman who whorks for hours, has a prestige job and has expensive clothes. The sense of being the best raises himself in other's eyes and gives please to him. 
On the other hand, many people don't understand how free time can be exanged on money. They think that not money but time gives a real chance for long life. Hours of working take the time spent with family, friends, partners. Free time actually exists for self-learning, non-official communication or just for relaxing or doing leisure activities. And also free time is very important for health. As an example we can provide a person who spend only 8 hours on work from Monday to Friday and has both all Saturday and Sunday as free time days. This person has time for own activities, new people, family, time to be a real member of the real society. 
Taking into account all the opinions I have to restate that the time is realy the money. The more time we are giving to work the more money is turning back and the same thing if we change the places. In my own opinion money is definetely not worth the time spent and I fully agree with people who want to live a life for time but not for money.

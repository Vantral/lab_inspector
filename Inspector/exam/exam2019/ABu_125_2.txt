In the hectic times of the present science is the subject which plays a vital role for mankind, it is increadibly significant for people of different ages and triggers heated discussions among people. Some people believe that it is the government's duty to carry out and distribute money for a scientific research. However, there is a growing number of people who think that private companies should do that. I agreee with this point of view for a number of reasons. 
Without any doubt, private companies can organize their reserch independently. Such organisations do not need to wait for the government's decison toward a particular research or work in the area of study chosen by the government. In addition to this, they can choose an area of the study by themselves and carry out the research using their own startegies. 
One more reason, why carrying out and funding a research by private companies is more beneficial is that not only can private companies specialize in the immensly popular ares of study, but they also can do a research on a subject that is not prevalent across-the-board. That means that the company will not be expected to chose a research connected with the most outstanding discoveries in medicine, biology, physics or history, for instance. They have a tremendous opportunity to choose any area icluding literature, archeology, mathematics and even linguistics. 
Taking into consideration all mentioned above, I would like to conclude by saying that private companies should really carry out and pay for reseach and organize everything which is necessary for the study by themselves. If scientific reseach is done by a private organization witout the help of the government, more areas of study will be developed.

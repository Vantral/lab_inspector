In our modern hectic world people try to overcome a huge number of problems every day. Needless to say that governments play a significant role in this process. Some people are convinced that to help citizens of all countries is impossible, consequently, rulling elite ought to pay attention only on helping people in their own country. Personally, I definately disagree with this statement and I have some persuasive arguments to prove my point of view. 
First of all, wealthy counties could try to solve the problem with a small amount of food in poor countries as they have money and resources to do it. It is widely known that African counrties do not have enough food and drinking water supply whilst rich european countries such as Great Britain or France waste their nutrition as it is abundant in their countries. This way, they might not to throw their food away, but to transfer it to countries that have a need. 
Secondly, some global problematical issues require united forces of all countries in the world. For instanse, international community has faced the severe problem of terrorism for years. It is imposible to find out solutions to it unless all nations start to tackle this issue. Compared to ten-years-old results, now global community that includes a lot of countries has achieved brilliant results as fatalitities because of terrorictic acts has decreased. 
Taking everithing into consideration, I strongly believe that united attempts can shift our world in better conditions because blossoming countries could easily help ones that are in crisis and, additionally, the international community has achieved great results in solving global problems such as terrorism.

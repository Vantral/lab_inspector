It is belived that the family playes the most important role in shaping children's behaviour and character. However, there are people who claim that the outside world influences children more. In this essey I am going to discuss this two points of view and at the end I will give my own opinion on this topic. 
On the one hand, home is the place where people spend the biggest part of their childhood. Naturally children are prone to immitate adults behaviour, especcially the behaviour of their parents. That is why very often children from families where parents drink or smoke start to do the same things in order to be like their parents. Moreover, children are respect their parents and always try to do everything to make them happier. Lots of pupiles try to do their best at school for their parents to be proud of their children. 
On the other hand, when children grow up they tend to split from the family. Firstly, children want to be a part of the seciety and to do so they have to behave in a particulare way. Sometimes the pressure of the society is so huge that children start to drink alkochol and smoke in early age in or to be a part of the "cool" company. Secondly, school influences chil's development significantly as it is the place where children learn how to live and function in the society. Often children from schools with strict diiscepline have less problemes with timemanagment and become more successfull in their future career. 
To conclude, there are two different opinions on what influences the child's life more the family or something outside the home. Personally I regard that family plays important role only during the first three years of child's life, when all other external factors will shape his or her character untill he or she becomes an adult.

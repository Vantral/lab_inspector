Two pie charts provide data about the main reasons of usage of public libraries in the United Kingdom in a 10-year-period, namely in 1990 and 2000. 
In general, in the beginning of the last decade of 20th century, public libraries were visited by over one third of a billion citizens. The main persentage of visits was connected with borrowing and returning books. While in the beginning of 21st century it was still the main reason, the same process considering DVDs gained its popularity. 
According to the charts, in 1990 approximately two thirds from the whole amount of visitors used libraries for borrowing books, whether in 2000 there was a sharp decline in that tendency - little more than a half of all readers used libraries for that purpose. Studying and finding information were the less popular reasons for visiting (only 10%). However, in 2000 the persentage of citizens interested in borrowing DVDs plunged and made up nearly a quarter of all visits. Despite the interest in information finding doubled, studying became the least popular reason for visits (2%).

Some groups of people tend to reckon that high income should be number one priority, while others state that nothing is as precious as spare time one can have and even all money of the world do not worth that. 
On the one hand, the process of working for money can bring a number of benefits. First of all, some types of jobs can bring satisfaction. For instance, they might involve such parts as travelling and communication which can substitute the need of doing that too often in one's spare time. Business trips and meetings do not ever have to be daunting, it is quite feasible that for some people this can bring pleasure. Secondly, some personalities do not know how to invest their free time right, they do not see anything behind their own jobs. They want to buy luxurious cars and houses but that might be enough for them. 
On the other hand, if people earn money all the time they do not always have a chance to spend them on everything they planned to. To be more precise, they might simply lack the opportinity to spend time on that as work can become everything to them. Moreover, sometimes huge salaries might be connected with extremely responsible vacancies which imply having regular meetings. So some people would perefer to have less money but spend more time with family rather than with business partners. 
In conclusion, it is vitally important to mention that the choice between personal life and financial wellbeing has never been the easiest one. It is up to everyone which values to put on the first place. In my opinion, however, a person should find a balance and earn money in a way which will not distract him or her from his dearest and nearest and which will provide him with opportunity to have enough free time for themself.

The table and chart below illustrate the percentage of girls and boys who had problems with their weight in Canada from 1985 to 2005 and the percentage of teenagers who did regular physical activity in 1990 and 2005. 
Looking at the chart we can notice a sad picture. The percentage of overweight teenagers, both girls and boys, had been increasing during the given period. In 1985 the percentage of girls who had problems with weight accounted for only 14% of the population, while in 2005 this percentage reached its peak with 22%. The same situation had happened with the percentage of overweight boys. Comparing with 11% in 1985 the percentage had increased by 14 point and in 2005 it accounted for 25%. 
Things definetely go better with teenagers who did regular exercise in 1990 and 2005. If in 1990 only 51% of girls were physical active so in 2005 the percentege raised up to 77%. Boys have an even better situation. They managed to increase the percentage by 30 points. And if 1990 it accoounted 57%, in 2005 87% of boys did regular exercises

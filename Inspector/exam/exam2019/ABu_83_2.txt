Architecture, to some people, is merely a building tool for comfortable dwellings, while others deem aesthetics to be important, and want the buildings around them to be aesthetically pleasing. My opinion aligns somewhere in the middle, however I tend to lean towards the importance of aesthetics. While I do think that buildings should serve their purpose, I also think that creatively crafted, beautiful buildings would only benefit both the city and the people. 
To my mind, a city is nothing without its buildings. Buildings reflect the traditions, customs, culture, and history of their place of origin. I think it is crucially important to erect buildings which are aesthetically pleasing, thoroughly thought-out by architects, as the architect's love transcends their creation, passing onto people living in the city, or just travelling by. Beautiful architecture can elicit a plethora of positive emotions, among which are awe, happiness, tranquility and excitement, and those emotions positively affect people. Moreover, beautiful architecture affects the country's financial infrastructure as well, as tourism brings in a considerable amount of money. Swarms of people are attracted to architectural feats all over the world, travelling long distances and spending large sums just to be able to see it in real life. 
On the other hand, some beautiful buildings are just beautiful, with no real purpose or convenience. Cement boxes with beautiful, enticing wrappings. 
Overall, while I do agree that buildings should serve a purpose other than just being beautiful, I consider the aesthetics to be just as important, if not more, for eliciting a variety of emotions from the onlooker, as well as being economically beneficial.

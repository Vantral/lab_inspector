Nowadays the leisure time is extremely essential for many people. But also, the populatity of money is ganing popularity. Now I will try to discuss both positions. 
On the one hand, for many people it is far more important to be with their families and dedicate themselves to their children and spouses, than earning money. For example, my brother had a chance to build his career and earn more money, but in that case he would not have enough time to be with his son, so the son was more crucial for him and he had chosen the family instead of money. Also, if a person acknowledges the fact that he wants to be an artist and he knows that this job will not bring a lot of money, he may choose his favourite work and be happy and free but do not have a great fortune. 
On the other hand, many people believes that without money you cannot be a family man because children demand a lot of money. For example, if you have 3 children and do not work, your children will die because of hunger. Moreover, there is a notion, that nowadays all types of fun is pretty expensive and if you have a lot of free time but do not have money, the time is useful. For instance, if you work on a part-time work as a cleaner and a halfe of a day is available for you, but your salary is little, you will not be able to visit the exhibition of your favourite artist because of absence of money. 
To conclude and sum up, I would like to say that I personally believe that it is really important to be able to combine a hard-work and ability to relax from it. I suppouse, that every person has a choice and if you see your happiness in workind from sunrise till dawn without weekends, it is your right. Also, if you want to be with your family more often tou should do it despite the all factors.

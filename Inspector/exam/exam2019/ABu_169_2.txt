Building a brilliant career and having more leisure time are currently being one of the most relevant issues considering the choice of the lifestyle. 
Putting work above everything has been a popular behaviour of people under 30. In the first place, they seek to become well off, which means travelling to a vivid secluded place, obtaining a new qualification, or purchasing genuine clothes. In fact, they are influenced by the need to prosper and possess some choice which is the main advantage of wealth. Although, there is one less positive reason for people to spend more time in their office. Overworking may be causeed in many causes by some adverse events occured in someone's life and serves a way to escape from the dull and hurting reality. 
The opposing view, which is paying more attention to leisure and, hence, possesing more money is equally widespread, namely among the youngsters. Those who give up building a full-fledged career, explain their view by being less concentrated on consumption, which requires money. Instead of earning and wasting, they prefer being satisfied by the least and concentrating on how they feel and doing the activities they are good at. 
To my mind, both of these points are naive. As in the recent decades we have become free to choose the way of earning a living out a wide range of jobs, earning money cannot be an obstacle to living a full life and vice versa. Many buy assets, that bring revenues in the long term, work out of home and then may spare a few hours to their family and pastimes.

There is a bar chart and a table presented below. The information in the bar chart indicates the percentage of Canadian boys and girls having overweight problems since 1985 till 2005. The table shows the percentage of boys and girls in Canada doing regular sport activities from 1990 till 2005. Overall, it can be obsereved in two graphs, that by 2005 both percentages of overweight children and those doing physical activities on a regular basis increased singificantly. 
It can be seen from the bar chart that the percentage of overweight kids was gradually growing since 1985. The first striking feature that should be mentioned is that before 1995, when the percentage of overweight boys and girls was equal (16%), there were more overweight girls than boys. But in 2000 and 2005 there were less overweight girls than boys even though the difference between them was pretty small. 
The percentage of children doing regular exercises went up in half since 1990 till 2005. 
Besides, in both 1990 and 2005 the percentage of girls doing activities was lower (in 1990 51% - girls and 57% - boys).

The bar chart and the table depicts the information about kids who suffer from obesity from 1985 to 2005 in Canada and the amount of youngsters who practised daily exercise in the year of 1990 and 2005. 
In general, acording to the chart, overweight tendency has been slightly increasing throughout the period. Nevertheless, the number of obese boys and girls remained approximately equal. Turning to the table, there is an evident raise in childrens' health care in 2005 in comparison to 1990. 
Considering the bar chart, in 2005 the disease has reached its peak among kids, with a quater of obesity suffering boys and 22 per cent overweight girls. In 1995 both sexes were equallyn overweight with the percentage of 16. 
The table repsesents that in 1990 both more than half of boys and girls did regular exercises, with 57% and 51% respectively. Fifteen yers later, the amount of girls who did physical activity on a regular basis has increased on more that a quater, while the rate of boys has raisen to 87%. 
Taking into the account information that both charts provide, an evident correlation between the raising obesity trend and increasing popularity of sports can be seen: the latest comes as a consequence of the first.

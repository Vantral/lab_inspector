In the world of science it is crucial for scientists and researchers to find a workplace, where it will be feasible to use their knowledge and skills. Many of them are working in the governmental funded laboratories, but today the tendency of private companies paying for and carrying out scientific researches is gaining popularity. In this essay, I will discuss the advantaged and disadvantages of this phenomenon. 
Undoubtedly, this issue has many upsides. Firstly, the affluent people who own private companies can bump as much money as it is needed into researches. Seondly, and as a rule, private companies specialize on different spheres of science and it is easier for government to collaborate with them. For example, Elon Musk, being an owner of different projects and companies such as "Space-X", not only bump his money into their work, but also gets many grants from the government. Thirdly, there is a space for participating in international official scientific meetings, where th counterparts can share their achievements and discuss ideas. 
On the other hand, only private companies and their workers benefit from the scientific breakthroughs: it is up to the owners whether they will share their discoveries with the government or not. Moreover, the black market and illegal trade are flourishing because owners of companies deside how to use their intellectual capital and how to make money utilizing them. That is why private conpanies are dangerous in some way - it is not a secret that some of them are sponsors of terrorists organizations thriving all over the world. 
To conclude, despite there are many downsides of science beeing "in hands" of private companies, upsides definately outweigh them. However, some actions should be taken in order to control and limit their autonomy and cut them off the black market.

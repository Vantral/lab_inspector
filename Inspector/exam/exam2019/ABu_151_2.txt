Some people prefer to earn money and work more than 45 hours per week, rather than others prefer to have more free time and earn less money. These both opinions have discused for many times. And this essay will provide facts about both ideas and then will be mentioned personal opinion. 
To start with, it is necessary to point out the fact that the mojority of people have an idea that money is a crusial part of their life and they forget about their personally life and health. It is scientifically proved that with increasing working hours, a person becomes less productive and has a disbalance in his life. For instance, in 2010, the significant growth of divorse was increaed in 30 per cent. And the issue of this event was disbalance and overtiming in work. 
On the other hand, the idea of working less and have more free time has more benefits than drawbacks. Compare to work 10 hours per day, it is significantly better to spend time with friends outside or go in for sport. It will improve your health and personally hormony, which will lead you to a happy life. But having to said that it still important to work, becouse everyone wants to earn enough money and let themselves everything what they need. Moreover, it is important to work less than 40 hours in order to keep fit and be healthy. 
To conclude, I will mention my personal opinion. The idea of having a right balance of working day and free time is suitable for me. I strongly believe that people should not work 24/7 in order to earn more money, it will lead to many problems. In order to ovoid it, people need a balance in their timetable.

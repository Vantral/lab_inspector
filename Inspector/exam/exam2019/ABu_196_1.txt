These tables depict the number of males and females hired in three different areas in the year of 2010. The first table illustrates Indonesia, the second one shows Australia. 
Firstly, from the both tables it is clear that in terms of agriculture in Indonesia, females are more in demand rather than males. In contrast, Austalian workers in this sphere are unpopular. It is well-know that Australian land is more arid than in Indonesia. What is more, male workers are hired more frequently than female ones. 
Secondly, the tables also illustrate that in both countries sevices' sector is wide-spread. In Indonesia, there are more men who work in services but in Australia the women are those who hold a leading position in the sector. 
Finally, both in Indonesia and Australia, industry is the area where men's labour is more valuable. Nonetheles, the figures in Australis are slightly higher. 
To sum up, the position taken by people in Indonesia and Australia may depend on their gender. Subsequently, that may be connected with cultural worldviwes, attributes and national attitudes. Moreover, the popularity of these three employement sectors mostly depends on the climax of these lands.

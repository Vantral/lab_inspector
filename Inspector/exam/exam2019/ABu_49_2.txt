Recently I came across an interesting issue whether should governments help all the people in the world or they have to pay attention on their citizens only. The statment was that government were engaged in helping only people who live in their own countries. From my perspective, It is quite controversional issue. Let's see who is right. 
On the one hand, of course, it is very beneficial when you can get support from other countries. Moreover, it can be crusial in a particular situation. For instance, A poor country has no money to invest it in health care systems and education as well as a country can be in a difficult situation at the moment, that means after war. In such sityations a country has determined economic stability and has no money in its budget, as it was with some countries recently. Other goverments and that are members of OON helped such countries to reestablish economy and refresh the country's security. 
On the other hand, sometimes citizens need help from their governments. In this case, then a country waste its money on another country it can inflict damage on citizens. If we talking about such problems, it can lead to loads of other issues and can lead to idleness and so on To conclude, it is up to a person whether to maintain such point of view or prefer and probably live in a country that help others. The both points of view have their own pros and cons.

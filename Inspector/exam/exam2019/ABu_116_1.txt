The pie charts given provide information on the use of public libraries in the UK in 1999 and 2000. 
The total visits number in 1999 was 350 million, meanwhile in 2000 the number decreased significantly and was 290 million. The need to borrow or return books makes the majority of both charts: 65 per cent of visitors in 1999 and 55 percent in 2000. In the year 1999 to read newspapers or magazines was the second popular reason of visiting public libraries and makes 15 percent of the chart. 
To study and to find informaton were reasons of visiting equally popular according to the graph of 1999, 10 percent. While in 2000 the number of visitors coming to study decreased dramatically and was 2 percent, the number of people who's demand was to find information increased and made a quater of the whole gragh. The second popular reason of visiting libraries in 2000 was to borrow and return DVDs which makes practically a quater of the graph and did not exist at all as the reason of visiting in 1999. The demand on reading newspapers and magazines became three-fold less popular in 2000 in comparison with 1999. 
All in all, the reasons of visiting such as to borrow books and to find information remain popular throughout the whole period, while to study and to read newspapers became unpopular. A new trend of borrowing DVDs appeared and made a valuable pie of the whole chart.

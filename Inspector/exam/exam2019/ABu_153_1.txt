The following table provides the information about the amount of employers in two different countries in 2010. The data is given on a basis of the employers' gender. 
What stands out from the tables is that services sector highly requires workers in Indonesia and in Australia as well. However, as for Australia there are more women working in that sector than men, while in Indonesia, it is men who are hired more to do that job. What is more, the quantity of male workers in Indonesia is lower than in Australia, so is the amount of men working in services. 
It is clear from the table that Indonesia requires female workers in agriculture sector more than in industry. Only 8 per cent of women are involved in industry. 
As for Australia, it can be seen from the table that agriculture does not play such significant role as services do. Only 1 per cent of women and 3 per cent of men work in that sector. However, 88 per cent of female workers are involved in services which is, besides, the highest indicator in the table. 
Overall, the evident fact here is that Australia is more developed in terms of prividing services and less efficient concerning agriculture. The gender indicator plays an important role in both countries as the percentages show some significant differences.

In addition, the number of people coming to the library in order to read some printed media decreased threefold, turning to 5% from 15%. In comparison to 1990, in 2000 five times less people come to the library to study (10% and 2% respectively).

In 2000 twice as many people as in 1990 visited library to find some information they need, constituting 20% and 10% respectively.

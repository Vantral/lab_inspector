The line graph shows the information about the energy from fossil fuels in five different countries and its percentage. Overall, the percentage of energy from fossil fuels distributed differently in five countries. 
To begin with, from 1970 to 2015 the energy from fossil fuels was increasing in the United States. We can observe the same situation with India from 1970 to 2015. While in France the energy from fossil fuels remained stable from 1970 to nearly 1975. Then there was a decline in 1975, then an increase and from almost 1977 the percentage of energy from fossil fuels started to fall down until 2015. 
Moreover, in Sweden there was a decline as well.

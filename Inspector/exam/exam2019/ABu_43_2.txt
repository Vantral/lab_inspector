Nowadays many people say that it is unreal to provide all people on the Earth with equal conditions, that is why local authorities should concentrate only on helping inhabitants of their own states. In fact, I completely agree with them, so this essay will discuss why it is not essential to support all the countries in the world. 
First of all, I think that if governments help other lands, they will spend a lot of money. Usually the ruler who maintains not only his or her own state, but also several countries at the same time, they have a lot of problems related to economy. For example, when Turkey helped Georgia after the war with Russia, spending money on organisation of new and firm shelters, houses and different buildings including shopping malls, hospitals, supermarkets and other places for people, there appeared an economic crisis. As a result, many inhabitants of Turkey suffered from it: they lost their jobs and some of them even could not buy products for their families, so Turkey's help for Georgia had a negative impact on its economy. 
Secondly, I can claim that when governments provide other countries with all facilities, they do not know what kind of people live there. Obviusly, in all the lands of our planet such perpetrators as terrorists inhabitat, and they can harm and even destroy the whole world, and helping other states it is possible that we make contributions to appaling terroristic acts which lead to a lot of deaths. For example, if the USA will provide Syria with weapons and other dangerous things, undoubtedly, we will suffer from it, because a lot of criminals who create dangerous plots live there. 
In conclusion, I can deduce that helping other countries is impossible, and it is not a good idea, because it can cause such negative circumstances as problems associated with economy and terrostic acts.

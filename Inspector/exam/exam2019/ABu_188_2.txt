We live in a twenty first century, in a century of modern technologies, wide range of opportunities and hustling and bustling. Our job plays a big role in our everyday life. We all work to earn money, but some people work less, earn less money, but have more free time, and some people work more, earn more but have not got any free time at all. What is better? These views are very controversial, but let's discuss them both. 
One the one hand, people who work more and earn more are super-heroes, because they spend hours at their work places and earn a lot of money for themselves and their families. They want to earn more money to make their life more beautiful and happier. Of cource, money is not equal to happiness, but it is a great tool to achieve that happiness. Also, they work for their future, to provide themselves with a good life conditions in the future. That type of people are usually very rich, and they spend money on their luxury holidays and something really special. 
But on other hand people, who have more free time are much happier. They enjoy their lives because they can spend their time with their friends, families, girlfriends and boyfriends. That type of people do not care about their sallary, they need money just for food, clothes and taxes. They do not need luxury cars and premium hotels, they are satisfied with all they have. 
All in all, i would like to conclude that everything depends on a person. Somebody prefer to work more, somebody prefer to work less. If person is satisfied with his life, he will not work more, if he is not satisfied, he can spend hours and earn more. But it is very important not to forget that money is not equal to happiness, it is only a tool to achieve it and their should be a balance between earning money and free time.

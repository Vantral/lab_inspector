There are several billion people living on the Earth, each country has its own resoures, policies and takes care of its residents differently. Some countries form special unions to establish support and justice for other countries and their inhabitants. Some people believe that helping people from another countries might distract them from solving their own problems, but others disagree. 
Providing help to other countries can be beneficial for both of them. The first reason is mutual support. The government of the country, which recieves help, will, probably, help the supporter in the perspective. The second reason is the permission to use a country for other countries purposes. For example, many european companies have their production in India and other countries, which have cheap labour force. The residents of India it means new work places, an ability to earn money, while the european companies benefit from additional employees, who produce cheaper goods. 
On the other hand, it is not always that good to support other countries. Firstly, it might lead to the sustainable development of the country, which was provided with help. In the future the economy of that country might outdo the economy of the supporter and suppress its worldwide trade, leaving the helper in a bad condition. Secondly, the budget of a country might be spent wisely on more urgent needs existing within its boarder. The government should establish security, proper health care system, pensions and so on.

The two pie charts show us the main reasons why people in the UK visited libraries in 1990 and 2000. Before making any comparisons, it is crucial to keep in mind that the total number of visitors has decreased between these two years shown on each chart. 
Talking about trends, the most striking feature of these two charts is that in 1990 as well as in 2000 the vast majority of people came to libraries in order to borrow or return a book, 65% and 55% respectively. Neverhtless, this is the only distinction these two charts share, as other causes vary a lot. For instanse, while in 1990 the second-popular activity was reading newspapers and magazines, which attracted 15% of all visitors, in 2000 the main reason to come to a public library after returning or taking books was to find information, which was the ground for every fifth visit, unlike 1990 when it attracted only every tenth visitor. The popularity of reading periodicals has decreased dramatically during these ten years and has reached the number of 5% in 2000, while the number of people who used libraries for their studies has also declined from 10% to only 2% in 1990 and 2000 respectively. Another thing that makes these two graphs so different is that in 2000 18% of people came to public libraries in order to return or borrow DVDs, an option that was apparently unavailable in 1990.

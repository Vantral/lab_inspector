It is widely believed that a good-looking building is the the main aim of every construction, while others disagree and claim that each bulding should be comfortable to live in rather than to look attractive. I consider, that living in a well-constructed bulding is much more crucial for two reason: is much safer and cheaper, besides buildings of a beautiful look are extremely expensinsive and there are more important ways of how to spend money in the state. 
First of all, ordinary buildings are considered to be safer, as sometimes designers' houses because of their suffisticated structer are much more vulnerable and are exposed to complete destruction during natural disasters. Moreover, exquisite houses are often bought by the rich, that is why they are more expensive than regular houses, and at the same time tha is why the cost does not improve the quality. For instance, there was a case in Japan when a work-of-art bulding started to crumble after earthquake, meanwhile ordianry houses remained safe. 
Secondly, it sounds irrational to waste money on awe-inspiring buildings to catch attention, when there are some difficulties with infrustructure in the country. What I mean is that the government should invest money in the construction of houses that everyone can afford, rather than building beautiful skyscrapers that the majority cannot buy. Otherwise, it can cause people's dissatisfaction with the authorities. For example, in China people went on a strike, because they were against building of a modern skyscraper in the province, as they laked houses, but such accomodation they could not afford. 
In conclusion, I do not see any sense in producing beautiful buildings, as they are mostly expensive, unsustainable and do not meet the needs of ordinary citizens who seek for affordable place to live in.

The question whether advantages of paying for and doing research by private companies outweigh its disadvantages is a very controversial. In order to find a question, this essay will cover both sides of this coin. 
I would like to begin with advantages. Private companies, which have a deal with science, invest money just in this sphere, while the government has to take care of all people and all spheres of our life. If private companies pay for the research, government can change the flow of money in social sphere or education that need more improvements. Moreover, private companies will focus on research that is significant for those who invest money in this company or for those who make money on selling scientific magazines or who work in pharmaceutical sphere, for example. Another benenfit for private companies is that they can choose what topic is more necessary to be investigated. They specify in one area and they keep going deeper in it, not leaving a single peace that was not explored. 
On the other hand, there are many drawbacks of this idea. Private companies do not have toshow everyone the way the research was done and they can twist the figures in order not to show the study that is full of holes. What is more, private companies can easily hide some sideffects of their product by distorting their evidence. Such thing can be done, because company wants to suit its own ends. In this case, people who are going to buy this product will suffer from sideffects that can cause the variety of disorders or even death. From this point of view, government is not interested in twisting the figures. Its main aim is to improve living standarts and prolong people lives. 
To conclude, I would like to say that there is a number of pros and cons of the question who should invest money in research private companies or government. Still, it becomes clear that in order to get real results it is better for government to take care of this sphere.

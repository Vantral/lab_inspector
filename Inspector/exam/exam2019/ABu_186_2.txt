In our live there are two options that people may choose. You wheather work hard and gain decent sums of money or spend your time in a way you like but deal with less cash in your pocket. 
Most of the people find their happiness in money and to reach their ends they dedicate all the free time to work. In such a way these persons may spend their whole live being occupied by work or business. They rarely know when to stop and always strive for more. Once they reach their money goals they realise they're over 50 years old and have nothing to spend money for as all the courage of youth has gone long ago. 
There is another type of people who prefer free time over a huge bank account. For such people life goals are quite different from those that first type people have. They believe it is reasonable to spend your life in such a way that once you become old you realise it all was not in vain. Money here plays a side role since not everything can be bought with them. 
In my personal opinion, everything should be balanced. It is good to have enough money to never worry about your restaurant check but at the same time it is wrong to sacrifise your life for money gaining only. Becoming a hermit who is never worried about financial status is not right as well since there is a need to think of your schildren future. As it was previously said, everyone should find their balance.

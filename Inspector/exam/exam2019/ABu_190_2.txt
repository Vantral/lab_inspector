In our world there are many people who choose receive more money and have less free time and also there are people who want to have more free time and receive less money. This essay will discuss two different point of view and prove why someone is right and someone not. I think that people who choose have more free time are right. 
I strongly believe that it is very important - to live. 
Because when you spend all your time at work, you have not enough time to live. For example, I know that all business man must spend all their time at work, because their work need to have a total people's attention, if you have a week-end, you can lose much money. 
Also in my opinion, people who have enough time to live are more happy, because they have time for travelling (maybe they have not so much money for travelling as business man), but they are happy. You can be happy when you live in hostel and not in the very expensive hotel and have 1 mounth for vacances and not only 3 days. 
Peolpe who are happy are also healthy, and who are hardworkers, they often suffer from different diseases like depression etc. It is better to have less money and to be very healthy and happy than have much work and 3 days of week-end per year. 
But it is also important to say that there is another opinion which is very different from my point of view. Some peolpe think that when you will work hard for 10 years, after this time you will have much money and free time. But I do not think that this system is good. Because it is always difficult to stop receive money, when you have much money. 
In the conclusion I can say that all people should enjoy their lifes, because we live only once, it is necessary to stop and just relax and remember that the most important benefits in life are health and happiness.

Science plays a paramount role in our today's world. A lot of scientific researchers and discoveries are conducted every year. Nowadays more and more private companies participate in scientific sphere, they carry out as well as pay for more researchers that goverments do. A lot of people see huge benefits in this new trend, however others believe that the disadvantages of the trend outweight the advantages, because of several strong reasons. 
The first reason is that governments are more likely to carry out a valid and true scientific research. Private companies have their own interests in conducting a research. Such companies are usually interested only in earning money, and they can twist figuers and numbers in order to get better result. What is more, private companies do not care a lot about the knowlage of their scientists, who may not even have real dimpolas. 
The second reason is that a goverments' research is easier to check and to prove as goverments are obliged to keep all of the information and data. Private companies usually do not save their data in order to keep an opportunity to twist figuers. Moreover, goverments are usually more comtrolled while conducting a research, they have competent speciallists and scientists with real diplomas. 
To conclude, I would like to say that indeed nowadays private companies do the majority of scientific research. I personally think, that the disadvantages of the trend outweight the advantages and agree with the main reason for that. I would believe more to a scientific reseach conducted by a goverment than by aprivate company.

One of the most topical issues nowadays is that private companies provide more scientific works in contrast with governments. They do much more trials and research paying for them themselves without state grants. This occasion have more benefits than drawbacks because of several reasons. 
First of all, research, which is done by private companies are independent. These firms are free of governmental influence and pressue. They seek for honesty and truth in all aspect of their activity. Companies do trials and present much more reliable results, which are really proven by science. This data publishes honestly without any changes and rigging in favor of somebody's interests. 95 The second upside of scientific research by nongovernmental organisations is the size of field of study. As a rule, if companies do trials they have paticular purposes for that. So, the leaders of these organisations are ready to pay a wealth of money for this scientific research. To be sure that the results are reliable and studied in depth, companies provide the greates financial support for them to search much information and solve many topical problems, which organisations are intersed in. So, such reseach has no lack of funding. 
To sum up, it is important to outline that unfortunately, most part of research paid by governments is rigged. This fact should lead people to the decision to trust more to independent trials and studies if they want to get honest information about some topics. At least, they should compare independent studies and these onew, which governments are paid for.

It is impossible to help all the people in the world, so the government should focus only on helping people in their own countries. 
In these day and age, there are so many people that need some support from others but people are not able to take care of everybody, so government in every country should pay more attention to those who need help. 
I agree with this point of view. In my opinion, such sociale programme will let countries to save more lives and increase the population each one. For example, there should be developed free medicine care for those who cannot aford the service. There are children and retired people who are unable to walk to hear, to see but they also have a right to live a full life. Moreover, govenment should make more beneficial the transport, schools, and all social supports. For example, make opportunity for disoredered students to study in special schools where they will be understood.

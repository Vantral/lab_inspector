The chart and table gives information on the percentage of overweight girls and boys in Canada during 1985 and 2005, as well as percentage of youths who regularly exercised in 1990 and 2005. What is catching the eye right at the beginning is that in 2005 the rates of overweight girls and boys had risen significantly. 
It is worth mentioning that in 1985, as well as in 1990, the percentage of overweight girls is higher than the percentage of overweight boys. However, while in 1995 all children share the same percentage, in 2000 and 2005 the percentage of boys being overweight significantly rises, making it higher than the percentage of overweight girls. 
Speaking about the statistics on regular physical activity, we can see the same pattern for both girls and boys: children were more physically active in 2005. Yet there is still a significant difference between them. There were more boys who exercised regularly both in 1990 and 2005, while there was a fewer percentage of girls who did the same. 
Overall, it seems that both percentages of overweight and physically active children became higher over the years.

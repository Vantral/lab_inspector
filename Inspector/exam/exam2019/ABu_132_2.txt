In present time private companies are believed to who pay for and carry out most scientific research rather than governments. In this essay I intend to speculate wheather the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages. 
First and foremost, If the government does not get involved in sposorship of scientific research, It leads to the creation and formation of a new research market. Besides, the competition between privite compamies stimulate the economic growth of the country. Secondly, private companies have a right to decide what scientific sphere will they sponsor. 
However, some disadvantages cannot be ignored. To begin with, government is considered as more powerful tool for paying for most scientific research as it is much more affluent than private companies. Secondly, if the governtment does not carry out most scientific research, it does not have a vested interest in scientific development of the country. 
By and large, some advantages does not outhweigh the disadvantages.

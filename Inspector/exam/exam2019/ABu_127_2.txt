There is no doubt that science is one of the spheres, which need to be studied carefully by those who provide us with scientific research. The question is, whereas private companies instead of governments should be responsible for carrying out this type of research and pay for it as well. In the following essay there will be several arguments presented that are for and against puting this responsibility on public companies. 
Scientific research must be carried out correctly, that is why fake research and faliure in real one are vorbidden. That is why, giving all rights to public companies is not a good idea. Public companies are usually independent, which allows them to act as they want and write what they want, as nobody will check information they provide in scientific research. 
On the other hand, scientific research needs a lot of money, which government sometimes gives out for medicine and military sources. In this case, public companies have enough money and time to provide the country with scientific research. What is more, public companies have more desire to find out and to invent, as for good achievements they will be awarded and gain a direct benifit from it. For instance, they could win more clients, or get a status of the best public company, which will increase their profit. 
To sum up, there are more positive sides than negative once. As is written above, public companies can easily fake information as they are independent, but still they can be benifitial for governments as they have money and interest in carring out any kind of research. Even if public companies are allowed to carry out scientific research, it would be better, if they are placed under control of the government.

In modern society money has a huge role in life of many people. While some people claim that they prefer to work more to have enough money than have more free time, other people believe that it is better to have more free time and less money. This issue is going to discuss both these opinions. 
First of all, nowadays a lot of people want to work harder even if they would have less free time. These people think that they could earn enough money for their future life if they would work everday without weekends. They want to make a huge amount of money to create a good conditions in the future. As a result, these people do not have enough free time, but they believe that it is a good investigetion for the future. 
However, many other people say that free time is a crucial thing and, as a result, they have less money and more time for themselves. These people think that it is very important to have enough time to communicate with other people. For axample, to meet with your grandparents, to go for a walk with friends or just to spend time with your childrens. Of course, people should work to have enough money to survive, but time is more important than money. 
To sum up, I would like to say that both these views are important. As for me, I totally agree with the last view. I think that it is really importhat to have enough free time to improve yourself. Many people want to learn new language, to read more useful books and so on, but they cannot do it. And the most common reason for it is a lack of time, as a result of work.

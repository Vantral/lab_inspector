The graph illustrates the amount of people of both sexes who are occupied in three employment sectors that are agriculture, industrial sector and various services. The data presented refers to 2010 and shows the trends in two countries, namely Indonesia and Australia. 
Overall, the Australian people tend to be less interested in agriculture as the numbers here are immensely little whereas Indonesian workers have this sector well-developed as well as the one that includes the provision of services that constitutes twice as many people as in Australia in this area of employment. 
Taking a closer look at the data, it can be clearly seen that Indonesian men are highly employed in services (about 56%) which is quite similar to female workers whose percentage of job occupation differs only in 7%. Having considered this developed sector, industrial one is not that popular among both male and female workers as far as the percentage of them together does not exceeds 25%. In contrast, Australian men's number of employees in industry is twice as increased as Indonesian one and makes up 32% which, however, shows a huge difference in comparison with female workers - here only 11% of women opt for this sector. Moving to the least popular area of employment in this country, agricultural sector's data shows approximately 5% of workers among both men and women being occupied while Australian people do choose to provide audience with services as almost three quaters of male population and about 90% of female one are occupied in this sphere.

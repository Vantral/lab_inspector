Carrying out new scientific researches is a crucial part of our modern world and there have been a lot of arguments about whether private companies should take care of achieving new breakthroughs. Obviously, there are some pros and cons of this idea. 
Talking about the advantages, if scienfic researches are commissioned by private companies, governments will be able to tackle other important issues that they have, such as environmental, political problems, etc. Also, in our lessons at university we were told that researchers usually feel more motivated working on private companies because the funding and grants are substantially higher. 
However, there are a couple of drawbacks of this idea. Firstly, not every company can provide money to conduct scientific researches. Thus, the lack of money is the major problem. Secondly, sometimes private companies prefer to pay for researches that they find beneficial for themselves, for the prosperity of their entreprise. In this case, some global projects such as space and see exploration can be abbandoned. 
In conclusion, it is important to say that there are some benefits and drawbacks of the idea to make private companies pay for new discoveries. We cannot just rely on them because sometimes they can face crisis and lack of money. Also they can have their own vast interests in carrying out some researches. So, we can say that disadvantages of this idea outweigh its advantages. That is why is it still better for governments to provide money to scientists.

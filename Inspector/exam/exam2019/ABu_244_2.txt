The question about influence on children is always triggered heated debates. Some people believe that the family plays a key role in shaping children's personality, while others suppose that the outside world has a greater impact on kids. 
On the one hand, from the first steps of children family's life revolves around them. Parents serve as a role model for kids, their behaviour, habits, the way of talking and even style in most cases can be used by a child later. Besides, we inherit not only the genes from our parents, but also the traits of character. Moreover, the environment, in which a person was brought up, haivily affects them, and in future they will set out to bring this atmosphere into their families. Finally, parents can supress their children sometimes and make them to do only what they want, making parents' dreams come true. 
On the other hand, there are other powerful agents of shaping children's personality, for example, school or university, friends, partners. There is a wealth of examples in literature or films that show, how a bad company can completely change the way a child behave. Moreover, teenagers can be bullied in school, and this can cause a lot of mental traumas or even the emergence of suicidal ideas in their minds. Finally, all people are affected by the collective symptom, that makes them change, do things that they would never do, and in schools this phenomenon often happens. 
In conclusion, I described how family or other different agents can influence the development of a kid, but I strongly believe that the family has the strongest impact, because even if a person was affected by a bad company and changed, when they grew up, they would mostly behave like their parents.

In the modern world a lot of people's attention is focused on questions, based on problems of children's education. Some people assume that it is necesary to give your sibligs all knowledge at home whereas opponents suppose that nothing could be more influencial than "street" education, in other words those places, which are located outside home. In this essay both two counter opinions will be presented. 
Family has a huge impact on how child act and develop. First of all, parents try to provide their children with vital view on life, which is based on parents' life perception. This outlook on life includes a huge demand on what their child will do in future and how he will live in the community. So, parents try to create for their children a massive ground by developing an interest in many spheres like: sports, science, drawing and so on. As a result, child understands what he wants better. Also, parents give to their children an appropriate model of behaving in community like manners, which pave the wave for getting a job, for example. 
Another opinion is that the main school of children's development are places outside home, which have a great influence on child's life. A great number of people suppose that children's decisions, which they make outside their home are better. Thus, they become more independent and have their own outlook on life, which is supposed to be more correct without parent's stereotypes or failed dreams. Also, child gets enough skills and ambitions to build his own career without parents' financial help and gives the priority to what he prefers more. 
All in all, home plays a vital role in children's development, as parents try to give all their knowledge for children but I suppose this knowledge sometimes not objective. So, I suppose that child should create his own perception on life by receiving it outside his home.

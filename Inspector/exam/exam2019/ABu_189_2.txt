Nowadays many people are inclined to invest more time into their jobs rather than leaving time for leisure. Yet, other people have a polar view on the issue and prefer to live in an opposite manner. 
On the one hand, from the point of view of those who spend more time on their career it is essential to be able to have enough funds to sustain their way of living. In fact, such people believe that it is much better to have a richer lifestyle and have a possibility to spend as much money as they may desire on their leisure activities even if they are rare in their amount. Such people usually put quality before quantity therefore they are satisfied with having less free hours but no limitations when it comes to choosing from the options available to them. 
On the other hand, those who decide that having more free time and work less tend to focus on the flexibility and overall easiness of their schedules. Such people wish for opportunities to participate in as many activities as possible and are usually dissatisfied when they do not get the chance to fulfill their needs. Additionally, they usually do not need to spend much money and look for cheaper ways to pass their time with pleasure like buying discount tickets to theatres and travel tours that are on sale. 
In conclusion, it is essential to notice that both views have well-adjusted logic behind them and therefore should be equally respected. Neretheless, personally, I would dare say that I find myself to be more supportive of the first opinion for that I believe that it is better to have a luxurious vacation once a few months than to have to limit myself to lesser spendings, but have much more free time in general.

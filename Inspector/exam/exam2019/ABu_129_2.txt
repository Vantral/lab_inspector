Today science remains one of the most crucial spheres of society, making vital breakthroughs for humanity every day. Consequently, not only governments, but also private companies invest in scientific research, sometimes even more actively. To my mind, this phenomenon is highly positive and has its strong advantages. 
First of all, private companies do not focuse on some particular areas, as governments mostly do, because they have to develop, for example, military technologies first. At the same time private organisations, such as "Tesla", can carry out various unusual experiments and create that scientific devices that they have a vested interest in, still enhancing the knowledge of the entire humanity. 
Another important advantage is the fact that private companies attract people's interest to science in many ways, inspiring new generation to search for a job in the this sphere. Such people as Elon Musk give an example to the adolescents, as they try not only to make serious discoveries, but also to follow current trends and present science as an exciting and truly respectful area to work in. 
However, there is one major drawback in this situation. It is quite obvious: private organisations sometimes simply do not have enough money and resources to do research. It depends both on investors, who are not into the sphere and presume that their money is wasted and owners of the companies themselves, who may set their research prioroties in a wrong way. 
All in all, to my mind, the fact that private companies are those who instigate most scientific research, pumping their own money into it, is highly beneficial and advantages outweigh the disadvantages here. Such organisations are not afraid of experiments and create a positive image of modern science. (296)

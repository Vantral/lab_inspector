Nowadays many people claim that the building's appearance does not play a crucial role, it is much more important for construction to save its aim. Also people believe that architects has not reasons to worry about building constructions that are works of art. I support the idea, that the look and the purpose of the buildings and constructions are equally important, because people like watching stunning and fascinating objects, also the appearance of many things attracts our attention. 
Firstly, let's consider the churches. We all have took the granted that churcehs has their unique look. People come to pray in churches, it is a saint place and I do not think that someone will come in a dirty and inattractive place for praying, because in this case we want to stay with our thoughts, that is why the appearance and the purpose of this place play a big role. 
The second construction I would like to discuss is the museums. It is a wonderful places which should be look beautiful and marvellous, because people from over the world came in particular country to visit the museum and I suppose they want to see something outstandung. For example, Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. So many turists are craving to see this place, they take excursions, spent their money and want to see something that is worth. 
To sum up I would like to say, that I agree only partly with this opinion. In cannot be denied that the perpose of the building plays crucial role, but the appearance of it also palys enormous role and architects should pay a lot of attention about repairing old buildings of art and build new ones.

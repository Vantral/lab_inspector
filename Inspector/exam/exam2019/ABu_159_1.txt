The tables provide information on the percentage of men and women employed in agrictultural, industrial and service sectors in 2 countries, Australia and Indonesia, in 2010. 
It is clear from the tables that in both countries the majority of both male and female employees worked in the services sector. In contrast, the other two sectors differed in popularity, with agriculture being the second most popular employment option in Indonesia and the least popular one in Australia. As for the gender distribution of workers in the countries in question, the majority of industrial workers were male in both countries. However, most people working in the agricultural sector in Indonesia were women, while the opposite trend was noted in Australia. 
There was no significant difference between the figures for male and female employees in the services sector in Indonesia, with 56 and 49% of workers being male and female, respectively. In Australia the situation differed slightly, as female workers outnumbered their male counterparts. More precisely, 88% of women occupied jobs in the services sector, while 65% of men worked in the same sphere. As for the industrial sector, it was more popular among Australian employees than among Indonesian ones, although in both countries the percentage of male employees was twice larger than that of female workers. Agriculture seems to have been the least popular employment sector in Australia, occupied by predominantly male workers. The opposite trend is true for Indonesia, where women constituted roughhly a half of all employees.

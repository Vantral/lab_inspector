The information presented on the given chart and table shows both the percentages of overweight and physically fit boys and girls changing throughout the time. The most striking conclusion we immidiately draw is that the amount of obese boys and girls have almost doubled in 20 years. But, the percentage of physically active children has also risen, although it's not anywhere near the rates mentioned higher. Comparing the gender-based information, it is evident that there is only a slight difference between girls and boys in terms of obesity. Speaking of fitness, the number of physically active boys is higher than that of girls in both 1990 and 2005.

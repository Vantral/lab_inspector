Nowadays, the is a rising problem of social help from the government. It is considered, that the countries need to focus only on needs of their citizens, without taking into consideration the global worries. This essay will be focused on the reasons why such actions will increase benefit for everyone. 
First of all, such actions will help the countries to protect their citizens from natural disasters. By this is meant, that the government is able not to send their people to rescue missions when it comes to disasters and invest into prevention of such phenomena in their own lands. For example, Japan gives a considerable number of money to take steps for preventing consequences of earthquakes. However, when there was a collapse of mines in Armenia in the 20th century, they decided not to help in order to reduce the risk of diseases that could be caused by the radioactive emissions. 
Another significant point is that some countries face an immense number of social problems. They give away too much money in order to improve political status, but they forget about their own people who suffer from lack of money and vital medicines. For example, Russia sends help to deprived regions or forgives about debts. However, it is a well-known fact that a lot of people in Russia face lack of medicines or even have to find food in dumps, because their government does not want to set social sphere as a priority. 
To sum up, in this essay were described some of the reasons why the countries have to concentrate on the problems of their citizens. And I suppose, that only when the governments take such measures, there will be a positive change in our lives.

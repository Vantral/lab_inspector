On the chart the level of boys' and girls' obesity in Canada during the period from 1990 and up to 2005 is shown. From the chart it may be seen that the peak of children's overweight comes in 2005 with 25% for boys and 22% for girls. Moreover, the graph shows that the least percentage of children who suffer from obesity comes in 1985. Furthermore, in 1995 the number of overweight kids remains the same for both sexes, while in 2005 the gap between them appears to be the biggest with 3%. 
Considering the table below, we may observe that the level of children obesity in Canada is strictly related to their level of physical activity. We are given the figures for both 1990 and 2005 which are the points of the smallest and the biggest percentages of obesity. It is shown that even in 15 years the gap between sexes stands still in advantage for boys, however in 1990 that gap was 4% smaller. It may be concluded from both of the table and the chart that despite the fact that the level of obesity among children continues to raise with years, children still try to be physically active doing regular exercises.

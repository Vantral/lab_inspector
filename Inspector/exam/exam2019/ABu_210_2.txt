The citizens of global village profoundly value the significance of money and leisure time to the future of the soceiety. Many people believe that working extra time and becoming more wealthy is their main goal. Others oppose claimimg that free time is essential aspect for their wellbeing and more money will not make them happy in the way free time does. Both sides have their own justifications, but I partially agree with both ideas. 
On the one hand, in the modern society money plays an important role and without high income it is impossible to live your life to the fullest. Furthermore, your quality of life, health and family well-being depends on the parents salaries. Consequently, people choose to work overtime in order to provide sound opportunities for themselves and their families. 
On the other hand, leisure time is crusial for any person because it is the opportunity to spend time with family and friends and recharge batteries. Moreover, social interactions, sport activities and other kinds of entertainment help to boost your mental avtivity and increase your working potential. Consequently, the quality of work correlates with free time. 
To conclude I would like to say that a persond should find his perfect balance between taking extra working hours and leisure time. Working your fingers to the bones and having a lot of money have no value if you do not have any spare time. In the end, caring people and your life experience are important rather than the amount of money on your bank account.

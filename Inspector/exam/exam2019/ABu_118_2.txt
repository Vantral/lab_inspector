Nowadays more commercial companies than governments pump into scientific research and carry them out. 
No one cannot clearly say if this widespread phenomenon is totally positive or negative as it has several advantages and disadvantages that will be discussed in this essay. 
Talking about advantages of this phenomenon, one can say that commercial companies that have more money in their budget can provide scientists with higher salaries, better scientific equipment and conditions for conduction of researches in overall. What is more, now the governments can channel money into other spheres of life, for instance, transport system, medical care or school education. It can improve citizens' living conditions and their wellbeing. 
On the other hand, there are several disadvantages of the trend. First of all, the majotity of commerical companies that fund researches have vested interests in their results. Consequently, scientists can twist figures or statistics to suit companies' own ends. So, people who read about sponsored researches may see unvalid data. Additionally, private companies sponsor only those researches that they are interested in due to the field of work they specialize in. Other essential or even vital scientific researches are neglected and many crucial things, for example, medicines are not invented. 
To conclude, I can say that this trend has both beneficial and negative effects. Private researches save state's money for people's needs and give scintists a chance to conduct researches in improved conditions. However, the data of funded researches can be unreliable or other important researches are not given a chance to be conducted. So, advantages do not outweigh disadvantages.

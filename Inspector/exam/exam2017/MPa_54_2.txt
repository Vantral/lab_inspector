Some parts of people in each country are worried about export and import of their countries and sure that country only have to produce food for its own population. In my opinion, I strictly believe that this position is wrong and unfair for population and countries. In the one hand, if country will not export their products, other countries also will stop import in such countries. This way come such people could lose a lot of abilities which is very important nowadays. For instance, we will not be able to use iphones and other smartphones, it in Mcdonalds, drink pepsi and etc. In 21th century import and export has tremendous ifluence on developing of countries and people have to share their products to improve their country. In the other hand, I suppose that those people who think that country have to import as little as possible just worried about globalization. They sure the globalization has only bad sides and could destroy economic system of their country. For example prices extremely increase while salaries could fall down. By the way, if you want to imagine what would be with a country without globalization just remember USSR. Country which is isolated of the world could just wonder about developing as much as it wants but the effect will be the same as a candle in the wind. To sum up, I would like to say that I can understand people who want to "say no" to globalization, but I sure that these countries will not have serious success.

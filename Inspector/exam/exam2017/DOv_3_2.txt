The rise of the amount of crimes being committed by young people is a complex problem which is caused by multiple factors. In the last decades children had less time with their families. Instead their timeschedule has changed from the traditional approach, which had the prevailing role of the family and community, to the modern one, which radically reduces their influence with their moral values and gives the main part of teaching the youngsters to kindergartens, scools, colleges and universities in less extent. This tendention can be described as sistematization of the educational process which results in less attention for kids individuality, his or her concerns and interests and a strict demand for accomplishing several points, like this exam. Children feel less obliged to follow norms in the society as long as they deal with these points. Also it makes them less relaxed and more agressive what brings us to high crime rates. The second reason is constant urbanization in the would which is characterized by increasing part of people who live in cities. They face mostly people whom they do not know at all and have no feelings for them. That is why crimes become more probable and we register them more frequently. Young people do not feel ashamed for anybody as they see them for the first and the last time in their opinion. 
Parents and teachers should make kids responsible for their acts. For example show them how they should get ridd of litter by their own examples. That is important because people tend to leave litter in the places which are already full with it. That corresponds with the "theory of broken windows". Raise them with the idea of equality of people.

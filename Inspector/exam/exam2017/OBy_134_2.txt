Someone thinks that countries only need to produce the food for people and shouldn't iport something, This is an interesting idea and I will argue it with relevant examples and evidence. 
First of all, only producing food is to the one important thing that people want. All people must have clothes, electronics, furniture in own houses and etc. It country hasn't any special factories or manifacturies on the territory it must buy goods and products abroad. This is all usually people's equipments that government must fulfil, using different ways. If it all willn't that people will unhappy and angry. People will not be able to fulfil own requirements because mostly good will be very expensive or even is not been able to buy in shops or somewhere. In conclusion, humans will can go abroad that is very bad factor for every country. 
On the other hand, it is interesting idea to separate countries and people. Every country and government exist independent on others. All uses own resourses that they have and produce goods and food that they able to do. In this situation colture of countries cannot changing because of no import of unknown goods and food. Also, it is way to full stopping between countries and governments. Ebery country has only own materials and food and don't exchange with others. As a result, in world will stay undestroyed strong friendship between countries and people in different parts of Earth. 
In conclusion I would say that all countries must fulfill requirement of own population using different ways.

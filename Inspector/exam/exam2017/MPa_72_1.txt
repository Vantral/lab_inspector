The two graphs show us the information about average temperatures in Russia and Brazil (minimum and maximum). Now I will try to compare it. The lines in Russia and Brazil are absolutely different. In Brazil it is not fluctuated a lot: the differens between the hottes and the coldest temperature are about five degrees. In Russia we see a strong fluctuate: it has a peak and bottom. So, the differens between hot and cold temperature about 50 degrees! The average minimum temperature in Brazil is hotter than Russia. In Yakutsk it is normally to have a -40Â° degrees. In Rio de Janeiro o cold weather is impossible: it is munimum is about 17 degrees. The differens is 57 degrees! It is very much. Finally, I would like to add that the both graphs show us the peak and the bottom countries to compare. Temperature in Brazil is absolutely different from the temperature in Russia.

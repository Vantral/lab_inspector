A part of our contemporaries strongly believe that countries should only satisfy their own needs in food and also reduce the quantities of import food as much as possible. On the other hand, some people think that each country should produce that types of food which is more effectively for them and practise in importing other due to several reasons: more benefits, less spendings for producing and wider abilities to satisfy people's needs in food in any amount. To begin with, a part of our society sure that the amount of benefites from producing only for country's population will be enough for normal and effective development of the country. Although, the enemies of this point of view suppose that producing food for other countries will give much more benefits for the producer which will be able to help to increase the level of life of its population. Moreover, some people think that when country produce only for its needs, this process is not very expensive. Nevertheless, others suppose that specializing in producing several types of food will decrease the cost of this process which leads to increasing of benefits. This activity can help country to develop this producing area to rise the level of effeciency. Finally, a part of our contemporaries believe that import of food should be as little as possible for improve their own economy. On the other hand, some people suppose that import of food can help country to make wider the list of food which population can buy. In conclusion, I'd like to say that I agree with a point of view to produce for other countres and should not reduce, the amount of the import food.

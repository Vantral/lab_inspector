Nowadays the production of food is the burning issue on the global level. It is believed by some people that states should produce eatable goods considering only products that are consummed by the majority of population and import of foreign products should be reduced. It may be true but I tend to disagree with them. In my essay I will explain why I am not agree and will support my view by few examples. 
Firstly, natural recourses and the ability to manage them that depends on the level of the national economy, differs in each country. So possesions and possibilities of particular country may not allow it to provide the growing population by enough amount of food. For instance, some African countries with agricultural economy and dry soils that make impossible growing many vegetables and fruits have to import to save life of their citizens. 
Secondly, people that live in one country have different unic tastes in food so they simply cannot be satisfied by local products. Moreover, different tribis, nationalities that can be local or immigrant have their own gastronomical traditions. For example, Russia is the large multinational country and if it concentrates on producing of particular goods considered the most consummed by some people, many small nationalities will suffer. 
On the other hand the prohibition of import may develop the national economy especially agriculture, unite people who eat the same products though it can lead to monopoly and rising prices on local products. 
In conclusion despite the fact that some people believe that countries should produce only local products for their own citizens that can also develop economy by prohibiting import, I believe that country cannot be isolated in the field of food production and supply because it should respect needs of all people and consider its own recourses.

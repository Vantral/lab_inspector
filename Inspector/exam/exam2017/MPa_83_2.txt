Some people believe that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible. I do not agree with this statement, I believe, that the separation of labour and production is a great thing and that the globalization with global trade is the path of the future. Firstly, it is important to mention, that not all the countries could produce all they need just because of nature, climate reasons. Can you imagine the UK without tea? I bet you cannot. But they cannot grow it by themselves. Or should the people in Norway live forever without coffee and oranges? Secondly, we are living in the period of globalization, nearly all the countries are already interdependent. This does not mean that they become weaker. The global trade allows countries to specialize different niches of production, to use their resourses in the most powerful way. Economic isolation is not the way to solve the problems. You could just pay attention to history. The USSR was existing nearly totally of self production. Of course, the country was powerful and independent, but if you look into details, you would see, that people suffered from deficite of products and goods and not all of those, which could be found, were of great quality. In addition, the example of manufactures is suitable. The manufacture won the competition with self producers. To sum up, I want to say, that it is important to be independent for the country despite the interdependency. It is essential to use the abilities that the co-production with other countries gives, but not become fully dependent on imported goods. It is a both sided process. You should not only "buy", but also "sell" something. And then it will be a successful process. The globalization should be used carefully, but should not be ignored.

Nowadays there are various points of view about countries independence of global market. Some people are convinced that states should produce only the goods their population need and try to avoid import. As for my opinion, I completely disagree with this statement. In my point of view, countries cannot ignore import of various goods and their population should have an access to a wide range of products. I support this opinion for a number of reasons. Firstly, a lot of states have no ability to produce all essential food and as a result trying to avoid import can lead to a serious health problems among population. For instance, people from Japan are known to get used eating only fish and rice, but if they do not import some other important food, it will causes a lack of vitamines. Secondly, importing as little as possible can be inefficient from the economic point of view. Producing some products demands defenite resources and a country can face the problem of their lack. In addition, other states are supposed to have much more advanced technologies that allow to make price for this product lower. These factors explain why it is not worth supporting import at the lowest level. For example, it is much more profitable to buy cacao from African countries for European region. Taking everything into account, it can be concluded that inspite of the fact that there are different points of view about this topic, I am personaly convinced that only openness to the world global market and paying enough attention to import can help countries to make the life of their population comfortable.

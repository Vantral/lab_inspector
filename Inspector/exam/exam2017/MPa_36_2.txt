Some people belive that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as possible. Modern society has many ideas about ways of developing countries. One of them is an idea that countries should produce the poducts that their population eats. Also they should aim to import as little as possible. I don't agree with this idea because every country has not only something, that need to get their population, but differences in possibility to produce it. For example, China has good location and climate for rise and many countries in Africa have possibility to grown fruits llike oranges, bananas and others. It is cheap there and easier than in China. There are many examples of similar situations, when county can produce one product or one kind of product and export other products and it will be cheaper them to produce many products and to import as little as possible. One more argument is that same countries in the world get a lot of money when they export some products. It support their economics on the high level. There is other opinion that it is the best way for some countries to improve their economics. People, who have this opinion, think that it is the good idea for developing countries, which have hungry and low level economics. The idea is to produce food, which help to change situation in this country. To sum up it is better to produce only one kind of food but wit the high quality and the minimum costs, than to produce all food that population eats in this country.

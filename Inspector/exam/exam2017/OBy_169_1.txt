There are two pie charts with the information about transportation of different goods between some countries in Eastern Europe. Goods are transported by rail and by road. 
It is obvious that metals mostly transported by rail: 35% in contrast with only 11% by road. There is also a significant difference in transporting machinery (it is mostly transported by rail) and food products (in contrast it is mostly transported by road). Talking about non-metallic minerals, chemicals and manufactured goods, they are transported in rather similar proportions either by rail or by road. 
To sum up, metals, machinery and manufactured goods are goods that are mostly transported by rail. 72% of all rail transportations consist from them together. And other 28% consist from chemicals, non-metallic minerals, and food products. Non-metallic minerals are the most unpopular goods to transport by rail. More then a half of transportations by road consists from food products and manufactured goods (58%). The most unpopular goods to transport by road are machinery.

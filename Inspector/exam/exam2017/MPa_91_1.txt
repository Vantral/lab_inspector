The two line graphs show the changes of the average maximum and the average minimum temperatures. The first graph illustrates temperature in Russian city, Yakutsk, and the graph below demonstrates the same thing in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. That can be mentioned initially it is the sharp increase of both figures in Yakutsk from January to July. Thus, for 7 months the temperature jumps up by approximately 65C from just under -40 to a little higher than 25C. While the lines, which reflect the average minimum and the average maximum in Rio de Janeiro city slightly decrease since January by July. So that July is a peak for both line graphs. After that temperature in Russian city starts to dramatically decrease. Whereas the figure of Brazil city steadily rises. In additional, there is some noticable things, for example, the difference between average lines in Russia is about 10 degree in terms of all considerable period. While the gap in average lines of maximum and minimum in Rio de Janeiro is nearly 5Â°C. To sum up, the figures in Russia and in Brazil are extrimely different and completely differently behave.

Many people discuss the role of own production and imports and its influence to the country. The statement that every country. I the statement that every country should produce its own goods but import products play crucial part in every regions economic and social life. To my mind, import goods improve our life and make it easier. For example, the majority of Russian people use American, German or Japan cars because they are convenient, modern, safe and they include all necessary details which make driving better. Moreover, enormous amount of Russians prefer to wear import clothes from China and such countries because they are cheap and they follow to all fashion trends. Besides many drugs and vitamins from America and Japan are popular in all world because of its effectiveness and they give rather fast results. in contrast to that some people sure that give an opportunity for local production to develop and improve its goods and to attract customers. Moreover, local enterpreniurs must to stop their production because they are not competitive. For instance, there were huge company which create some traditional tatar clothes, shoes, jewelry and some home decorations things in Kazan. but it was closed because cheap chinese clothes appeared in the market. To sum up, I want to say that import goods should be in our market in cooperation with local products. It not only will improve the peoples lives but also will change the level of countrie's economy to the better.

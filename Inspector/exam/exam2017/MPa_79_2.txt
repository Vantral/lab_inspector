Any country nowadays produces a wide range of goods, including food products. Some people say that there's no need to produce food, which people in this exact country don't consume. Other people argue that there should be variety of goods and the extras have to be imported. I personally believe that the economics is the most important thing nowadays, and positive sides of import and export shouldn't be underestimated. That's why I support the idea, that every country should produce as much as possible to be involved into international market and get many monetary advantages from it. What is more, people shouldn't forget about differences in tastes - many people living near the ocean hate fish and other sea-creatures. On the other hand, what should countries do, when have no access to water resources? Fish is an obvious part of human's food ration, so without import and export, there would be no opportunity to take care about one's health. Of course, for some countries, restrictions about food and import seem to be profitable, giving population an opportunity to do what they are used to - for some fishing, for others growing rice or collecting tea leaves for example. However, looking into the future, for transnational and transcontinental community there is a big step back, reducing market flows and decreasing life level as a result. While producing goods for import the level of unemployment falls and society gets more money and earns a living. Taking everything into consideration, the issue of what country should produce or not produce is really vital nowadays. To my mind, countries should produce food not only for their population, but also for import. Only this way all countries will get required goods and money and recieve all positive effects of globalization.

Some people claim that the food and agricultural sector of a country should make food only for a country's citizens and import very little part of it. Other argue that countries should trade with each other at the food sector of economics. Firstly, some countries all over the world have not got developed agricultural sector because of such factors like climate or the lack of citizens. For example, Japan. Due to this fact they should trade at the international food market to make theirs' food sectors secure. Also, countries with sustainable food sectors exist but many of them have some undeveloped sectors of economics like technological. When these two types of countries trade by theirs "niche" at the international market they create a balance which benefits all of the traders. Secondly, if a country will produce food only for own population, its food sector will become unsustainable due to the some reasons: choice and surples of good. People need different types of food: fruit, vegetables different grass, exotical products for some needs and none country in the world could not produce all of them because of its territory, climate, location and so on and so forth. Because of it the lack of choice occures. Then, the demand on some types of products can be not high and these products will create a surplus which affects this sector of economy. To sum up, personally I believe that countries all over the world should trade with each other at all sectors of their economies because doing that they provide people products which will help them to live and improve our world.

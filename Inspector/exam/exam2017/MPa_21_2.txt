In our world at the all times sport developed as a naturally career. Person, who is involved in this sphere, should have some restricts as attitude for himself using anything drugs for increase a power level is the thaboo. Based on my opinion, I consider that we can provede a chance for reabilitation of sportsmen because in owing to person can recognise his sins. If people will follow the rule "our kindness and sportsmens honest" that fans stop to cancel beiliving in his favourite people. In instance, for increase power level sportsmens have a vast quantity of opportunities in order to achive desirably results such as apermanently studying, set one self on win, develop psycological factors and and never drop activity which choosed. If instead this list sportsmen will choose drugs in order to rocket to the top that I assume that such person is sick and donot have opportunity to compete in professional events and chelenges. At the all history of sport variety of sportsmens forgot elementary rule of consiqentences which bring drugs, moreover, they did not admire professional sphere own career. Nevertheless, the punishment should remain as ban for a limited period, namely 2 years. To sum up, it is necessary to understand that all people should follow the rules which are demand a carrer of sportsmen.

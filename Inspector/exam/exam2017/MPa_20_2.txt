The using of illegal grugs by sportsmen becoming more and more common thing and some people argue that athletes who use these drugs should be banned from different competitions for a short period, but other believes that they should be banned forever. Both views are worth discussing before coming to difenete conclusion. It goes without saying that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be punished. If these people banned for a limited period they can realise that they acted unacceptable and will not, probably, use illegal drugs later in their sport career. Moreover, sports organizations will not lose some talented athletes, who make that mistake, if they banned for some time. There is no denying that the athletes should be punished strong to realise that it is unacceptable to use illegal drugs on competitions. However, some of them can use drugs constantly and don't realise that it is wrong, so they must be banned from competing for the rest of their lives. It rediculous to deny that athletes who caught using illegal drugs once shouild be banned for all their lives because it is their first mistake and they can don't even know that using drugs is unacceptable. Moreover, their trainers can make athletes to use illegal drugs to win competitions if even sportsmen don't want to do that. However, if athlete cauth using illegal drugs a second time, he should be banned to take part in all proffessionall competitions forever, likely to use these drugs again, because athlete did not realise that using illegal drugs is wrong. Moreover, he is likely to get addicted to drugs and will use them later. In conclusion, all athletes who caught using drugs or all other stricted things should be punished, however it is not appropriate measure to ban sportsmen, who used them once from all competitions for the rest of their lives.

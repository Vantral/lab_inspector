Nowadays we leave in time of global economics and all counties around the world make money using such instruments like export and import. But some people support the idea that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and import as little as possible and I absolutely disagree with them. First of all, many poor countries import some products because they cannot produce them themselves, and if they will reduce from import it may cause bad consequancies for them. Take for example Africa. People there need water and meat, some medicaments and other products. This country cannot afford to produce it itselfe these products due to climat and land, type of ground. Without import and aid of other countries may could not exist. Secondly, today it is a century of global economics, all countries around the world communicate and trade. They export their products to another countries and make a big business, make money. These money can be invest in social, environment or science projects, which help people. What I want to say, we need to produce the food and trade it to another countries, because this enormouse global trade help to make money which will be invest for better life. Moreover, if one country isolates itself from others and produce the food that their own population eats and try to import as little as possible, it will be destroy. This country couldn't exist. The land and resourses may finish, came to the end, and it will be difficult to develop, to make food, products and money. To sum up, I believe that it is imposible to isolate from other countries and produce only your own food, it is very late to think about this thing, because of such process like globalisation.

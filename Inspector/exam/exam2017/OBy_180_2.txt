There is an opinion that high technology that implement everywhere in today's world effect badly on public health. Well, it is clear that modern technologies change lives including our health. 
The negative influence of modern gadgets can be easily noticied in everyday life. For example, increasing number of people suffer of reducing eyesight clearing due to the widespread of smartphones or laptops. People spend hours starring at them without noticing the harm. Another vital problem is obesity. Nowadays people become less and less active because of various means of transport or distant entertainment such as Internet. The need to move disappears when you can live a full life without leaving your house. 
On the other hand, there are many technologies developing to fight these problems. Firstly, there is brilliant gadget that helps us to control physical activity - a fitness brasetel. This little thing makes activities more exiting and useful. Secondly, many of the hi-tech corporations are trying to reduce the eye damage of the screens, for example, there are many readers with electronic technology that is much less harmful than ordinary screens. 
To sum up, I can say that it is totally unfair to blame modern technology for increasing health problems. The debelopers constantly add different improvements to make it better for use, but the people often become addicted to certain trucks and harm themselves.

Our country is fighting with the free copying and sharing music or films on the internet nower days. This theme is highly debated in the social media and news. Some people are of the opinion that this (illigal copying) is theft, and I am compleatly agree with this people. In this essay I am going to discuss why copying and sharing music and films is a fraud. 
Firstly, I sould say that this activity is illigal and there is nothing to discuss why free sharing is a theft. Scientists say that 15 per cent of young people (people of age under 25 years) are in jail due to this kind of fraud. In this way, if you are tring to sublish any pirate copies on the internet you are risking to get to the prison. 
Secondly, if you are a internet pirate you are stealing from a seledrity person. On the other hand, if you are downloading any content from the internet, your favorit music, for example, you are stealing from your favorit musician or if you are downloading a film, you are stealing from your favorit actor or actris. 
Some people could say that the amout of people who are able to pay for the music and films is lower than 50 per cent. May be it is true but we should anderstand that there are a lot of programs which gives an opportunity to by something for free or with a big discount. This programs are avalible for poor people, umenployed and for students. 
To sum up, I sould say that pirote copies of music and films are illigal and unmoral. I hope that pirote copies will stop exist in the nearest future.

The graph reveals information about proportional use of different networks by adult users. We can see 2 main features of data. 
Firstly, we can see that young people generally use networks more frequently. Popularity of network steadily decreases with age. For instance, more than a half of Instagram auditory is under 29 years. Nevertheless, LinkedIn doesn't have such enormous variety as Instagram does. 
Secondly, Facebook is the most popular network. Percentages of Facebook users are mostly twice higher than Instagram or LinkedIn ones. Even in the old age group, more than a half of people uses Facebook. 
So Instagram and LinkedIn has similar rates, which are doubled by Facebook. Also Facebook and Instagram have similar age distribution, which significantly differs from Linked In one. 
These differences might be attributed to different purpose and target audience. Facebook is posed as network for everybody while LinkedIn is used for employment purposes. So it is likaly that varying percentage rates are caused by these reasons.

The graph illustrates the market situation about unemployment in some regions all over the world in 2014 and 2015. 
The chart shows that the unemployment rate in general remained the same from 2014 to 2015. Also the situation on the job market constantly stays awful in N. Africa and Middle East. The percentage of unemployment rate on Middle East and Latin America decreased so the situation changed in the positive way. Only EU's data shows the increasing rate of unemployment. As for N. Africa and S. Asia the rate stayed the same. 
The level of unemployment in N. Africa is twice bigger than the worldwide level so the situation is urgent. The most radical fluctiation among all is fall of the Middle East unemployment rate's percentage from 11 to 9,6 over a year. The job market situation in S. Asia is on 3,9 level, that is 2 points less then the worldwide number. The saddest graph change happened with EU unemployment rate when it slightly increased from 7,5 to 7,9 during this period.

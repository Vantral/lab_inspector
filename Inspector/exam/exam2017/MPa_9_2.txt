One of the most controversial issues on discuss now is that should sportsmans who use doping, banned for a limited period or for the rest of their lives. This essay examinates both point of vievs on this question and provides my personal opinion. The main argue of people who think that should close the acsess on competision for professional athlets who takes illigal drugs during limited period is that every person has right on mistake. According them, taking doping can be solution which decide doctor or national sport team. Sportsman can be not compitent in question of using unknown medicamentes. It is not right to deprive sportsmen of the right take part in competition during whole life span because his doctor make mistake, for example, he did not check doping list. Besides that, person who uses of illegal drugs and get ban can be very resultative after punishment and reform his behevior. On the other hand, people who believes that it is right to give unlimited punishment for athletes who take illegal drags find the reason for repeated this situation. It is well-known fact that people who take drugs, have addiction. It can be cause to untrust them and their reform. There are a lot of examples when people continue to get illigal drugs after return after their punishment. In conclusion, both sides of this question have their merid. On balance, I think that it would be more humanistic if we will give an opportunity for continue career of sportsmans who take doping.

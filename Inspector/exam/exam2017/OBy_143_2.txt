Every country have a lot of people, and these people need food. Some country produce a lot of food, some - a little. And some people think that countries should produce how much food as their need and should import it as little as possible. 
I strongly disagree with that. I suppose that countries need to produce th food as much as thir can, and import or export food if they produse it more/less than enough. 
For example can be taken any city near the ocean. They produce a lot of dish and oceanic products. But people can't eat only fish. So, the city sell the fish and other products and bought bread, meat. 
Secondly, some cities builded only as military objects. They has no facilitye to produce food, they can only import it. Finally, a lot of European countries has not enough space to produce as much food as they need, That's why they specialized on machinery and refactoring. They sell machines and factories and buy food. 
Overall, I think nowadays every thing works fine and countries should continue trade between then.

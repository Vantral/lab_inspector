Nowadays a lot of people like to download music or films freely from the Internet. However, others think that this is a crime and these people should answer before the law for their actions. 
The first point of view suggests that doenloading music or films freely is normal thing. Their first argument is that they don't want to spend their money or things, which they can get without paying e.g. music, films. The second argument is that oftenly one can find in the internet things, which one can't buy, for example, old publications or old films and music, etc. the last argument is that sometimes one need to get something right now, but can't buy it in shops or in the Internet. Working on your course work, you might need documental films, but oftenly they are not for sale. 
The second group of people disagree with it. Firstly, they argue that musicians and film-makers spend a lot of money on their products and it's unjustice not to pay for it. For example, a lot of singers nowadays ask their fans to buy legal copies of new albums or download it from official websites for fee. Secondly, they say that it's a exome, because there is a law about protection of author's rights in the big range of countries. As one know, there're a lot of precedents, when singer or film-maker won the processes against websites, where their products could be downloaded freely. 
To sum up, the society is divided on two sections about this issue: the first one says that downloading things freely shouldn't be charged bad, however, the second one argues that it is amoral and illegal and it should be punished. Unfortunately, this question is still debatable.

People who make music or films do not earn that amount of money which they could because other people download illegal pirates copies of these types of art from Internet. Some people are sure that it is theft. 
Firstly, if people download something from the Internet, there is an opportunity that the quality of it will be awful, as a consequences, they cannot watch the film or listen to music. Secondly, copying and sharing music or films is theft, so, people who did it will be able to have got some problems with policemen. And, as a result, prisons waits them. 
However, another group of people does not agree with the first. They suppose that it is not theft, it is only a chance to make watching and listening more convenience. They do not go to supermarkets or music shops to buy there video - or CD-disks. In addition to this, if they want to watch old film, there is an opportunity that they cannot find it in shops. 
As for me, I would disagree with this statement. First of all, now we live in the century of technology, so, why do we need to buy these products? And, obviously, this "theft" helps musicians and film producers. I can explain how. Music and films on the internet are free, so, more people can listen and watch these, so, they advise it for friends and family, and, as a result, someone can buy film - or CD - disks and this piece of music or film become more popular. 
To sum up, there two groups of people. The first group decides that copying and sharing music or films is theft, and people have to stop doing it. And the second group thinks that it helps musicians and producers with their unpopular products.

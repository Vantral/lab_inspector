Nowadays people are fully engaged not only in personal but also in economic issues. They consider that the government of a country should control the food production, however some of them are eager to produce and import as much as possible. To my mind, countries should produce the food not only to their population. In this essay I will support my idea by giving some examples. Firstly, never before have the world faced such a high percentage of hunger in some countries. People do not have a permanent supply of water and food. Consequently, they die and only when the goverment imports the food will be the situation improved. I think the authorities should take into account that their country can have, for instance, a flood which can destroy the food and people can struggle without food. Furthermore, it is undeniable that political situations can change, that leads to the instability of food supply. A country can have a war, as a consequence, people migrate to find a better world and forget about fiels with vegetables. Therefore, the government cannot feed people and should import it from other countries. Turning on the other side of the argument, the country, that control the production of food and do not need import a lot, can have a better economic situation with a high GDP and good food supply. They not only do they use an appropriate approach, but also show other countries that it is possible not to import a lot. To sum up, the weather conditions, political situations could show that the government should produce the food not only for their population. Only when we understand these issues will be the world improved.

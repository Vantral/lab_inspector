There is a big quastion to goverments from all of over the world to produce food only to their countries or have some money and import as little as possible to others. To begin with I can say that of course it is fantastic to eat food only by your country. You can know where and how this products is grown or done. There are can be more places for working. On the other hand the food are depend on the climat. Not all countries have facilities, for instance, to grow up the rice or tea. Moreover, a lot of goverments don't have a money to do some products. Paradoxically that lands without big part of import are the richest in the world. For example USA, they have a lot of products in their country and thay cannot depend on by others. In my own view, goverments must do all that possible and produce the food only to their own population. Production must be done by this population too. Generally speaking, there are a lot of pluses and minuses in this quastion. Now we are in a big world, where life without import and export cannot be comfortable, but how many minds, so many reasons.

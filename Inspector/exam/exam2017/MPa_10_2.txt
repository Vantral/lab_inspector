Nowadays, a lot of athlets get caught using illegal drugs. Some people argue that such athlets should lose their access to competitions for several years, while other people believe that they should never compete in professional events. Some people thinks the the period of discfalification should be limited, because everybody can make a mistake in their lives and it is unfair to destroy their careers. For example, a young sportsman cannot realize that drugs which his trainer gave him are illegal and when he finds out this fact he desides to stop using it. Consequently, a short period of discvalification might help him to refuse from this drugs and normalize his sport condition. On the other hand, some people believe that only strict approach when athlets would banned forever can solve the problem. Overall, I believe that it is not neccessary to ban athlets for the rest of their lives, because there are some other methods to regulate the using of illegal drugs.

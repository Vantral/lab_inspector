There is not a day without discussions of the topic of producing more food inside the country for population and importing as less as possible. 
Taking into consideration my point of view, I can agree with this statement, because if countries produce more goods like food inside the country, it won't affect the economic position of the country and more money that were used for import would stay inside the country. These money can be used for development of farm industries to enlarge the variety of goods that can be produced. Also it is very useful for hard political situations when import of food cannot be processed or the country can have an economical crisis when there is not enough funds to import goods. That is why i can agree with his point of view. 
On the other hand, i cannot agree with this topic because, unfortunately, not all countries have possibilities and facilities to grow a large amount of goods inside the country. These troubles may be caused by climate and weather in regions where the country is situated. In addition not every country in the world have enough qualified workers that can produce this or that kind of food. And both these arguments lead to import which last but not the least thing. Without importing and exporting goods there will not be well-developed international relationships, which we need in our day lifes. 
To sum it all up, producing food inside your country is a great thing, that can be used in a proper way, but we cannot live without importing goods because of different really important reasons, which can cause difficulties in relationships with other countries.

Nowadays the considerable issue is whether the country trauds with others or vice versa if should obtain necesary good inside without import. I suppose, that import and export is one of the major part of modern economy. First of all all of country have own strong industry, for instance China is powerful seller on car market, whereas for other countries production of the last one would be difficult and expensive, that is why country should help each others. In my opinion, without support foreign coyntry noone can produce as much as we need. Also, the whether doesn't allow producing some kinds of food. For instance, fruits rasing is more easier in New Zeleand the in Russia, but it doesn't meant that we must live without it. The second beneficial affect of the import is technical process. People have to share the new application, information, even clothes, because appreciative of it we can develop, create some new things and make it better again and again. Also, I think that helth competetive on a world market is a really important boost for developing. It encourage us to make a contribution on production different goods and enchance level of service. If fact that when country participate in good market the quality levelled up significanly, becaus if they do not care about the quality they would lot first of all trust of consumers, so it can lead to crises condition and suffering of the not only country's economy, but all of the people who live here. There are a few disadventages of export. Nowadays it is no wonder that world experienced some political problems. So it is hard to amagine what would happend with economy your own country, when country depends on another one which can be involved in war. So, I disagree with opinion that countries only need produce the food that their own population need.

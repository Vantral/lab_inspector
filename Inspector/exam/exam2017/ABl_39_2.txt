In recent years people, who make music, films or books try to control downloading their products without buying. So, some countries (USA, for example) don't allow their people do copies or download without paying for product. But there are another ones, that don't control Internet sphere and it is become mostly pirate (Eeat Europe). In my personal opinion, illegal pirate copies in our reality is absolutely normal thing. Why? First of all, there are really a lot of content (music, films, books) in Internet. So, it is difficult to regulate this sphere. Second, some people have no chance to pay for useful content. For example, people in African counties or in some Asian counties really have no money to pay for books as more reach countries. And third, there are a lot of ways to make money for musicians, filmmakers and authors. They can give some concerts, lectures for money. Also, they can use advertising as a way to have money by recommending or advertising some products. 
To summarise the information above, copying and sharing music, films or books is normal process in modern world. As i have remainded before, Internet is very difficult to regulate sphere. Also, If we talk about regulation, there are some problems with it - countries, where human rights may be ignoring by its government, it is too risky to close platforms. In example of autoritarian counties we see the situation, when the most country's population have no information about political prisoners, about corruption and so on. 
To be honest it is need to say that authors of books, music or films really lose huge amount of money, but as i say before - regulation is not the best solution. And for musicians, filmmakes, authors there are a lot of other ways to have money for their products.

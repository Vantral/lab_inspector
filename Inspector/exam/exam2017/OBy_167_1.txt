The pie chart illustrates the ways of delivering goods in Eastern Europe during 2008, by rail and road. The largest proportion of goods delivery comprised manufactured goods for both types of transport. However, the percentage of the delivering of metal goods by rail was significantly higher than by road, while road infrastructure delivered the higher share of food products than rail transport system. 
As it is evident from the pie chart, the largest proportion of good's transportation by both modes of vehicle included manufactured goods, with 25% of delivering by rail and 28% by road. The second noticeable trend was that the percentage of metals transportation by rail (35%) was considerably higher than the proportion of delivering metals by road (11%). Moreover, the share of food production's delivery by road was nearly three times as big as transportation of food products by rail. 
As it can be seen from the chart, the percentage of transportation of machinery and chemicals wasn't significant for both ways of delivering. 
To sum up, the percentage of transportation of food production, metals and manufactured goods comised two third of total delivering share by both modes of vehicle.

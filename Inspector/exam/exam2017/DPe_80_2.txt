Illegal pirate copies cause enormous financial loss for musicians and film producers every year. Due to the Internet acces, films adn music can be easily downloaded and shared without any payment. In fact, such actions are basically a theft and should be punished. 
The Internet is still a rather new fenomena for society. Fitting it in people's lifes is a work in progress. In my opinion, laws, Constitutions and other official documents should be adapted to the new reality. The Internet have given more opportunities to thefts including pirating. The law have to adept to this situation and find a way to punishe such a crime. 
Pirate content cause great damage to artists and producers, and this is a problem that the Goverment should take care of. Leaders of countries are meant to protect their people and the civil rights in the country. Since pirating leads to damage for other people, the Government simply have to stop it. And the punishment is the most effective solution. 
Downloading and sharing music or films on the internet is fatal to the industry. Musicians and producers are not able to receive benefits of their work, and due to that they may lose the motivation to create new films or music. In order to help the industry to survive, the pirates must be persecuted. 
In conclusion, I would like to point out that existance of illegal pirate content is a significant modern problem. In my opinion, the only possible solution of it is presecution of pirates and, possibly, more severe punishments for them.

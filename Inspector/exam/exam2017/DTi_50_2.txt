It is widely known that music labels and film makers lose a great deal of money every year from illegal copying and free internet sharing. Some people say that people who do that should be punished, some think that such men are the new "Robin Hoods". Let us take a look at this problem. 
On the one hand, illegal copying is prohibited in almost all civilized countries and there is a reason for that. Music, books and films are considered as an intellectual property and it is quite uderstandable because artists are getting paid for composing, painting and film making only if their products sell, and if they do not have enough money for their living and creating they will just get another job, and this is why the law of intellectual property exists. It helps artists to get money they deserve and to have enough funds to make a quality product. 
On the other hand, nowadays it is not so simple as it may look like at first. Musicians do not often need labels to record their masterpieces anymore because personal computers went so far that now you can record some high-quality sound right in your living room so you do not need to rent a studio for that. As for film makers, they get millions just by dressing the main character in a big logo T-shirt of some reach corporation. In fact, money, that a film company is paid for commercial, can sometimes fully cover the film making expences. 
To conclude, I would like to say that we should obey the law of intellectual property. If we want to live in a respectful society, but sometimes, I think we should also ask ourselves what we are paying for.

Nowadays, there are a lot of drugs to boost your muscles and stamina and some sportsmen use this way illegal. So, there are two points on this situation. Some people think that thoose athletes should be banned for a time while other believe that such athlets should be banned on forever. Both this views are discussing before make a decision. It is rediculus to deny that some drug-used athletes can use it and then be sorried about this. So, they should have a second chance. Moreover, sportsman can use drugs and dodn't know that is illegal or he may not know that he use a drug. So, this situation can give an understanding of Athletes motives. As regards other point of view, using of drug make competition unhonor. So, if the Athlets use drug, he destroy the spirit of sports and competition. And this action cannot be forgettable, because if he did it once, he can repeat that, because he hasn't a right punishment of his decision. In my opinion, if sportsmen use a drug to improve his abilities, he defenetle must be banned for the rest of his lifes. Sport competitions have a rules and this rules must be worked, and if somebody break this rules, he must feel the consequences. Moreover, if athletes would know that punishment will be on all their lives, they will be thiked twice before use illegal drugs. In conclusion, despite on all arguments to ban Athletes using illigal drus on a limited period, there are a lot of reasons to ban them for the rest of their lives. Sports must be cleaned from any illigal drugs and athletes who used it.

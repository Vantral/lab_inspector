The bar chart depicts the percentage of unemployment in different parts of the world during 2014 and 2015. 
Overall, the difference between 2014 and 2015 in every region is not significant or abscent at all. The highest level of unemployment is in North America (12,5 per cent) and the lowest is in South Asia (3,9 per cent). The difference between the highest and the lowest point is quite radical as it is 8,1%. 
The biggest difference between unemployment rate in 2014 and 2015 is in Middle East, as it is 1,4% (11 per cent in 2014 and 9,6 in 2015). Then, although in all the rest parts of the world the unemployment level in 2015 is the same or less, the EU has the opposite tendency and its percentage in 2015 is higher in 0,4 points. Also, it is important to mention that the worldwide unemployment rate is significantly lower that in the most regions and it is only 5,9%.

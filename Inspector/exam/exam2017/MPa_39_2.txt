In the modern world there is an opinion that countries should shorten importing food as little as possible and start feeding the population by themselves. From my point of view, this issue is practically unbeneficial for the economies. In this essay I would like to explain my opinion by some reason. As everybody knows, nowadays there is a tendency to make the world globalized. This topic also mentions food productions. Labour separation, I think, is one of the most effective circumstances of globalization. Such countries as Canada, The USA, Russia, some Europian and African countries, China specialize on producing food, that is suitable for their climate. So one country can't develop the production of high range of food as its weather conditions doesn't allow to do it. Moreover, these countries have a significant experience in food manifacturing, the do it most effective and less cost demanding. So unexperienced producer needs to invest enormous money in order to make good with competitive price. In addition, many states receive their income only by food trading. The self food production means, that the country doesn't have a neccessity to import goods and the exported food could become unneccessary. Reducing export would lead to the reduction of economics in such countries as Greece, Brazil, Morocco and many others. In conclusion, I would like to say that this topic is very controversial from one side, subsiding imported food by that produced at home could bring some benefits to the development of an agricultural sector in some countries. But from another point this activity costs a lot of expenditures, that states may not have got. Furthermore, diminished food export ruins economy of agricultural countries as their only income comes from food supplying.

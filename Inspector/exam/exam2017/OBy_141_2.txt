There is an opinion that countries shouldn't produce the food for import and do it only for own population. I think, there are more disadvantages than benefits of this idea. Firstly, some products like bananas and qiwi cannot be grown by the natural way in countries such as Canada or Russia. Of course, this food are very popular. Therefore a large quality of it must be imported. The second reason against this opinion is economic processes. It is the important part of economy of a lot of countries. It would be deteriorated, if import stopped. This process gives a lot of money to governments of countries that they can spend for improving a quality of life of their population. That's why I disagree with this statement. Of course, there are some advantages of this politic, but there are numerous disadvantages. Import is important from part of economy.

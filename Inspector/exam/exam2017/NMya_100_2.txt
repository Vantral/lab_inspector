The 21st century is the era of technology, when even a five-year-old child knows how to use an iPad or an iPhone. But what problems are caused by enormous use of technology? 
First of all, it is pain in eyes. Office workers, who are working with a computer during the whole day are usually feeling terrible pain in their eyes. Eyes become dry and red, people see worse and have to wear glasses. I have such a problem, myself. Making a lot of home assignments on computer, I started to see worse and now I have to wear glasses. 
Secondly, another big health problem could be caused by radiation produced by computers. It is scientifically proved that if you always put computer on your stomach, you may have problems with degestive and genital systems. The radiation is very harmful and you need to be very careful and make a rest during long work. 
Thirdly, mordern technology allow to listen to a very good music. But everybody forget about the volume. If you listen to music very loudly, it may lead to deafness. Many young people don't understand that, what makes them hear worse. It is very importaint to choose right headphose, that perfectly suit you and don't harm your ear. 
To sum up, I should say, that health problems caused by mordern technologies are very importaint. Every person should carefully look after his health and the health of his friends and relatives. Because radiation can cause cancer, pregnancy problems and other deseases.

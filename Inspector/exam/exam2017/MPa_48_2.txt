Nowadays a lot of countries face the situation in which buying food abroad is cheaper than produce same amount with their own forces. This is not traditional way of things and may cause some fear or mis understanding. In my opinion, each country should produce goods that have highest economic value. For example, economic of Cuba is suited to produce world-famous tobacco and coffee, while Russian system proved itself good gathering minerals, gas, oil and producing weapons. Trying to find oil in Cuba or place for tobacco-farm in Russia would only cause expenses for both countries. In modern economic reality one county simply cannot be good at everythink and with modern level of international trade county can safely buy food abroad, while producing somethink else. At the other hand, the problem of topic have been discussed as long as process of globalisation started. Many countries and politicians, as well as economists are afraid of food dependancy, because in case of economical or political struggle they county may be left without veliable source of food, what way lead to serious problems, such as political instability or famine. Of course, food security is very important part of country's economical policy, but it should not be radicalized. For example, one of the mainest aspects of food security is not only producing all what you need in your country, but also separation of food sources. If you produce one part of your demand in some kind of food in your county and buy all other part in, for example another five countries, then losing one of your food sources wouldn't be big throuble, because you still have 4 else. All in all, globalization of worldwide trade and financial structures opens wide possibilities to specialize in their best economical spheres, while be sure that they can safely sacrifice some not rational products and buy it abroad.

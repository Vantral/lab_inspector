There is an opinion that each country should produce the food for its own consunption and shouldn't import a large ammount of food. To my mind, this idea is completely wrong and not actual nowadays. To begin with, in some countries there is no developed agricultural industry because of the climate. Producing some kinds of food in many countries can be more expensive then importing it from other countries that have a developed specialisation on agriculture. For example it is much profitable to buy bananas or tangerines in countries located in South Africa rather than try to grow it in our Region. What is more, producing the food that cover only consumption of own population means that there is no production for export. Countries produce food that is not difficult to produce for them. It means that it is cheap to produce some kind of food. Money that county earn from export can be spend on buying some food abroad rather than trying to grow it themself. Moreother, there are a lot of countries with long period of winter. Practically all agriculture stops during this period. It means that country should accumulate a lot of food for winter period, that is always difficult because of weather disasters such as draught or long rains. That is why there should be import, that will support population of country with food. Summaraising examples given above, there should be developed import and export in each country that will reduce less of food and money that country spend on growing food.

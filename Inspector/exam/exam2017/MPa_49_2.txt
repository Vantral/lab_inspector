In the modern world the globalization processes plays an important role and there are a lot of debates on this theme including the debate about export and import of the food. So, some people think that the food should be produced only for the own population of the country, another suppose that the import are nessecary. In my opinion, the countries can import products as much as they need to provide a better life for their population. Firstly, food import gives the opportunity for the population of the country to taste the foreigh products that can't grow in their country because of the different reasons, such as climate or the lack of resources. For instance, people in Russia have never had a chance to taste bananas, oranges and another exotic fruits without the import of products from Africa as an example. Secondly, the import of the food can be helpful for social sphere for example because of the taxes and fees which are taken from importing goods. When the government allows to import the goods, for example food from other countries they increase the amount of money in national economy. So this amount the money can be spent on different social projects, pension, education and medical treatment. Moreover, the wide variety of different food on the market can be helpful for enterpreneurs and for the development of competition which is really nesessary for development of economy in the whole. In conclusion, I want to say that trade, which includes import and export, is really important part of the modern world and is nesessary for the right economic development of the country.

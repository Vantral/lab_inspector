Nowadays with the rise of globalization and import all around the world, it is a quite popular belief that every state should aim to produce food only for it's residents and decrease the number of imported food goods as much as possible. As mentioned earlier, the globalization is at its peak right now and it is quite clear why such beliefs are popular: many people don't get enough of food products even if they are produced in the country those people live in. I, personally, disagree with such ideas, as despite many controversies, there is no healthy capitalism without healthy food exhange. To start with, the very first international trading was food trading. Back in the old times when the Roman Empire conquered and joined many states, those states started actively exchanging goods, including different foods, usually unique to one or another country. Moreover, continuing the topic of uniqueness, many food products are still made exclusively in some countries. For instance, rice is mostly grown in China, and without big exports from Chinese ricefields and open import policies of the other countres, rice would have been a very scarce product with an extremely high demand for it. The last but not least thing worth mentioning is the protectionism policy of the USSR. The Soviet Union was relying solely on its own products, but when it started importing unique goods such as cola and chewing gum, it provided a great opportunity for healthy international trade because of such high demand for imported products among USSR's population. So, to conclude things, is should be said that despite all controversies considering import and lack of food overall, in no way any state should go for policies like heavy protectionism, especially when it is about food. Food exchange and import is the very fabric of population satisfaction.

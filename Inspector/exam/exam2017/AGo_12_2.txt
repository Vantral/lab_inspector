It is a common knowledge that every country needs to make its general population happy and satisfied with their lives, and provide economic wellbeing. Despite that, views on the government's attitude to the foreign companies and firms, weather they affect national economy, differ. Some people claim there is an urgent need to protect the national companies by all means, while others disagree, persuading that people must have a choice in what kind of goods and servicies to perchase, the national or the foreign ones. In this essay I will try to prove why I found it more efficient. to strike the balance between these two ways, rather than to stick to only one. 
One the one hand protection must be sufficient if the national economy is in bad conditions. In this case the government should protect the firms of the country from the transnational corporations, which do not give start-up companies a chance to improve. This could be done by taxes on international production, which will eliminate the number of good competitors, but there must not be a total restriction. 
On the other hand, if the government is very strickt about protecting the national companies, it affects customers. This is because such restrictions imposed on people's economic freedom make them unsatisfied as consumers, because the national products does not satisfy their needs. Furthermore, each company needs to be involved in competition to become better. So, if the national company monopolized the national market, without facing any difficulties from the foreign ones, the quality of goods and servicies will probably be very low. 
To sum up, the country needs to put things into perspective and to realize that limitations and economic freedom strategies can be used together.

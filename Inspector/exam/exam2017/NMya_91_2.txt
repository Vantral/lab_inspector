Nowadays there is a belief that the food producing in some country should be available only for them and nothing else could be eaten. 
People travel abroad not only for marking the places they have been or for looking the sightseeings they can't see at home but to taste some traditional food in the country that they are visiting. For example, many people visit France not only to visit Eifel tower but to taste frog legs or green cheese. 
So why we can't afford this delicious food in Russia? Because the cooking recipe of this dilicies is the national secret that keeps tourist's interests hot to this country. 
However, there is another option why traditional food can't go abroad. We know that Asian countries are famous for their extraordinary spicy dishes. Roasted insects, heavily hot spicy chicken wings and other strange looking stuff makes tourists to decline to taste the national cookings of Asia. From my experence, only the bravest ones tried the dishes, and less liked it. As a result nobody wants to import Asian food to their homeworld, despite that Asian people don't need any other type of food, so they are happy with all they have eating it with sticks. 
To sum up, we can see that the world trends are messing up because of national mixings. More people are going to live abroad, more families are creating form different coultures. in that case I can't agree that food isolation in the country is nescessary. Our world slowly becomes as one, the traditions are barely thrown in the past.

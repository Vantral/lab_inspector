Some people claim that cauntries should minimize the quantity of imported goods and cut off exports. On the contrary, there are opinions that it is important to have open economy and cooperate with other countries in terms of free movement of goods and services. I think that there are solid arguments for both positions. To begin with advantages of close economy, the most important one is the encouraging of domestic producers. Decreasing import will consequence in lower competition that gives domestic economies possibility to grow and develop. Moreover, close economy is less dependent on the economic and political situation in the world. Thus country has better chances to remain stable in conditions of crises and uncertainty of the world market. However, open economy also has positive effects. First of all, not every country has necessary resources to produce enough goods for its population. For example, such countries as Africa and India cannot deal with necessities of its growing population, so they need help from countries with developed economies and availability of technologies. As well, open economy gives possibility to try wide range of diverse produts that cannot be raised or manufactured on the country's territory due to natural or economic limitations. Considering all of the above, I would lightly disagree with the statement of importance of open economy. In terms of globalization every country has to combine features of both economies and take maximum advantage of provided opportunities.

In todays world there is an opinion, that countries need to produce the food only for their own life, for people who live in this country and should to import goods as little as possiable. I can't agree with people who think so. Let us consider why it is wrong statement in my mind. First of all, nowadays all of us eat and drink differend goods from other countries. We do it by a lot of reasons. For example, some kind of food is more quantity, drink are more tasty and so on. Moreover, the main things in economic of all countries is import and export. It is also connected with globalization. Import and export are two factors and without them our economic system cannot exist. One county cannot produce only food for people, but if it can, this country could not produce something else. Another words, one country cannot be involved in different sphears of production goods and because of it there is an import and exports in our world. Last but not least, our choise about kind of food or drinks depends on our preferences. We eat different foreign food, becaus we want to eat something new, because we interested in culture and traditions of these countries and I think that it is a good factor. At the same time there is one advantage of isolate of food production. It is development native production in this spheare. To sum everything up, I want to say, that this point of view is not absolutely correct. This part of process of globalization have a good impact on culture development of people and world in a hall.

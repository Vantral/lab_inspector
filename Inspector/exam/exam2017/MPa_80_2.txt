Food production is one of the main issues that governments all over the world face nowadays. Some people convinced that countries should to take care only about their citizens and produce as much, as they need. However, other believe that authourites should should import some goods. I am strongly agree that world distribution and exchange programms are more beneficial. One reason for supporting food import is that some countries have better climate conditions. It is more useful and effective to produce rice, cons, coffee beans and etc in appropriate weather. It is well-known fact that Asia is a great rigion for rice production while African countries are famouse for their fruites and vegetables production. Moreover, some countries have lower costs of production specifict goods. That is why, it is more beneficial from economical side to import goods, that would cost high price to produce in the country, and export goods with lowe production costs. It is called world trading. Turning to another reason, no one country is saved from natural disasters. As the world becomes more and more globalized today, countries need to help other nations. The poorest people in Africa are suffer from hunger. So unined union of different countries may help them by exporting food. What is more, flood, stroms and other natural cataclisms may happen. That is why, goverment should be ready to solve the problem with food by importing it from other countries. To sum everything up, there are different reasons as economicall, as humanitarian to import food in other countries. Personally, I support the idea that countries should produce food not only for their citizens, but also for world trading.

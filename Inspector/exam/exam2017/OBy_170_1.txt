The pie charts compare the amounts of goods transported among Eastern European countries in 2008 by rail and by road. Overall, the most noticeable features of both charts are that the proportion of transported metals, machinery and food products significantly differs depanding on the kind of transport it was delivered with while the percentage of manufactured products, chemicals and non-metallic minerals stays relatively in and about the same figures. 
As it can be seen from the pie cart the proportion of metal among the goods delivered by rail was about 35% in 2008. In contrast, the percentage of metal transported by road commanded the share of only 11%, the major decrease by 24%. The same situations concerns the food products and machinery, the difference between two charts was about 19% and 10% respectively. 
However, the percentage of manufactured goods delivered between European countries doesn't depend on the kind of the transport, the proportion of manufactured goods transported by rail and road was about the third part of the whole delivered good. The amount of chemicals and non-metallic minerals took smaller parts virtually just under the quarter of all goods.

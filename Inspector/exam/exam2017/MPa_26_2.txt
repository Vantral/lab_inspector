One of the highly controversial issues today is what kind of measures should doing when sportsmens use of drugs, which illegal. On the one hand, there are people, who talk that they should be banned for a limited period about two years. But the other hand, some people beliewed that such athlets should be banned from competitions for the whole their lives. Then I am going to express my own opinion on the question. Firstly, let as talk about first opinion that time of banned should be fixed. Nowadays, there are a lot of legal drugs which are becoming illegal during the time. In that way, some of athletes can simply have not information about it. And the on the doping test can be showed that they use illegal drugs on this very moment. But I think that it is not a crime. For instance, recently such cases was in Russian team. These people was be banned from competing professionally for a limited period. Secondly, it is important to note that many people, who do professional sport often enough specially use of illegal drugs. Moreover, it is one of the part of their training. Thus, drug using help them improve their professional sport skills and they show better results, than other participations. There is a huge number of such cases. It incredibly prevalent in South countries. Even sometimes sportsmans using drugs almost whole their lives. They keep regards from different world and Europe competitions. But when International organisation will known about drug using, all of their medals and regards will be take. In conclusion, I would say my own opinion. I believe that there are a lot of arguments for confirm both opinion, but in fact carries a sentence of illegal drug using should in depend to various and individual cases in difference. Also in modern world, it is especially actual, that International organisation should more inform athlets about changes. In that way both opinion can be place to be.

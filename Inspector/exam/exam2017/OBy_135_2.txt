production of own food and minimized outsideng food. I don't agree with the statement. 
Firstly, every country have own unique land consistation. The product such fruits and vegetables will limit by having only one minerals and vitamins. For instance, thee pomodoro of the south country will have one minerals and vitamins. Although the pomodoro of the north country will have some other combination useful component despite same consequences. 
In addition, import play the big role on the frienshp area between different countries. The countries can have beneficial deal. For example, one country can share her secret method of producing something but for this the governments have to import big part. 
To conclude, it deal every country to decreasing diminishing import. Despite this, import have beneficial adventage.

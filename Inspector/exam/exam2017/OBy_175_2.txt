However, all these problems, in my opinion, can be reduced in some ways. Scientists nowadays have already invented special glasses that help to protect people's eyes from the negative impact of screens. In order to prevent problems which are connected with back and information volume people should give themselves some breakes during the work. They can go to the nature and relax or just do some gymnastics. These all might bot reduce the whole bad effect from the technologies, but will obviously help people to protect themselves. 
To conclude it all, we should not underestimate the importance of technology in our lives. However, our health is not less important, therefore, we should do our best and use all possible ways to reduce the bad impact from gadgets.

It is believed, that countries should make food for their own population and short their export. I quite disagree with this statement and suppose that Import-Export is one of the most important thing in World Economy. To begin with, We Should take into consideration, that exist countries that are not able to produce food due to several reason: climate, landscape, flora etc. And They get by exporting goods. If other countries stop this deals, countries, without food production, Just simply may die out. Secondly, If countries produce food only for their own population, It might be some kind of "food inflation", It might become unvaluable, There would be huge amaunts of unneccessary food and people would get rid of it as with rubbish. Meanwhile in poor countries children and adults suffer from hunger and thirst as in Africa. Thirdly, It would have a crucial effect of world economy, If It happens. Multinational companies would be destroyed. Some countries only survive by trading their products for Example Azerbaidjan. And if this countries lose their income from trading products it might impact on level of immigrants as citizens would try to escape to another countries. Actually, We have a live example of such country as North Korea. They leave on their own food, internet, goods and so on. Hey are closed from others. Undoubtfully, That nobody wants to even try to leave there, because every one heard about their strict policy. Hard to imagine this life "in a cage". To sum up, I would rather say, That Export-Import system is some kind remain the balance in our world. The stop of this process might lead to unavoidable, damaging and crucial consequances.

Using of any drugs that help athlets to improve their performance is forbidden, but nowadays it is only becomes more widespreaded. One people argue that a detetion of such drugs in a blood of an athlet should exclude him or her from professional competitions of any kind for a limited time, while others claim that the ban should last forever. On the one hand, athlets, which were caught using illiegal drugs, can be not guilty in it so a permanent ban will ruin their lives for nothing. For instance, a positive result of such analysis can be caused by a detection of a trail of some legal drugs or by a mistake. Moreover. It an be a result of an unfair competition: someone can add it to an athlet's food. On the other hand, a chance of such occasion is very small, consequently a caught person should be punished even for an attempt. Such strict ruler can prevent future cheating, because everyone would know the cost. But it will lead to making the check more complicated, because any mistake will not be longer allowed. To sum up, I think that both points of view are correct, but in my consideration the ban from competeting profesionaly for the rest of the live can help the professional sport to remain more clear, transparent and fair.

It is thougt by some people that countries have to produce the commodities domestically that their own population consumes and tend to import not too much from foreign countries. In my opinion, I completely agree with the statement, however, without importing any good from abroad may cause serious problems among the residents. In order to thrive, it is very important for countries to lessen the amount of goods that are imported from abroad. It is clear that countries can develop economically only when the amount of exported goods exceeds the amount of imported goods. However, it is very vital to take into consider that population is free and has a right to choose and eat whatever they want. In this case, not all countries are able to provide their population with commodities domestically. To explain my point, it is very easy to take the example of China that provides population almost with all commodities and also imports a lot of goods and food from abroad, because it cannot grow every food domestically. On the other hand, it very crucial to take into consider the role of population. It is clear that almost in all countries of the world, a lot of people make and set up business with overseas business people and provide their families with the good they are willing. Furthermore, nowadays under the growth of globalization countries are becoming more dependent on each other both economically and culturally. It leads to a closer business between countries and makes it a bit impossible to introduce this kind of method. Furthermore, it is very important for countries to thrive economically which leads to a decrease in producing of all goods domestically. In conclusion, it is very essential to produce as much food as possible in the country in order to provide population with food and goods for which they are ready to purchase and also be less dependent on other countries.

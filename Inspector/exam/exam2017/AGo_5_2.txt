Some people believe that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible. I think it is not correct. Let's try understand this opinion. 
All countries are different. There are small, big, huge and tiny countries in the world. And everyone has different possibilities and facilities. For example, Japan can catch the fish and can't produce the oil. So, it's great when one country can changed with other something because two hands can try something new, maybe they need. 
Also it's not good to produce a lot of the food, which will be not fresh. People can't eat so much. In every industrial country the producing the food is more that it needs. But poor countries need in the food, and, of course, in the money. So they try to import fruits, meets, vegetables, animals and (даже) people because they are poor, they need money. Their children don't go to school because they help their relatives on the fields. The import of the food is very important part of their life, because they can't import gadgets, electronics and so on, because they haven't money for the learning and technologies. 
I think it is important to connect with different countries. And the import the food is one of the most interesting ways to know something new - new fruits, new vegetables and so on.

There are a lot of studies about the behavior of goverment. Some of them relate to the food problem. Although, some scientist state the import of products is not bad, many people belive that nations should produce food almoust as much as their own population can eat and minimize the import. Firstly, a big food import is a root of the food dependence. If the country does not produce enough food for its population, it tends to increase food supply from abroad. However, other countries offten do not want to export some goods, including food, due to political reasons. This gives the other countries a power to control some nations. Secondly, countries should produce slightly more food than their populations need in order to minimize the import, because of the fact that there are a lot of unpredictable season disasters that can deminish the amont of food that is planned to be grown. For instance, the rain that occurs every day within about a week can destroy farm systems for growing some kind of grains. In conclusion, nations shoud produce such amount of food that is needed only by their residents and almost do not import food. In this case, countries will have good independence and be ready for some unexpected nature disasters.

Some people argue that farmeres need to produce the food only to their counties. And goverment should import very little part of food to another countries. I disagree. In my opinion, people from over the world shouldn't be greedy about food, and they should give food to everyone who need. 
Today we have industrial time. A lot of many productes are made in factories. It is a good benefit to large number of countries. But there are agraculture countries. Their economy depends on farming. This country need to produce food to import, because they do not have any possobility to live. 
But some people believe that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats. People have a big choices of food. They usually buy a lot of productes from supermarket and don't eat all, what they bought. And a lot of meat, vegetables, and fruites are become waste. Countries can safe their resources. For example, they can use money for factories, because they need not care of farming. 
Despite this argument, some people argue that we should produce a lot food. Nowadays, one of the most important problem of the modern world is hungry a lot of people. European countries do not have this problem. However, Africanian and Asian countries suffer from hungry. This country cannot produce enough food to feed own population. And it is our duty to help them. If some country have a lot of food to import, it will safe a lot of people from hungry death. 
To sum up, there two points of view. The first, countries should produce many food to import as much as possible. And the second, countries shouldn't do it. I think that if people produce many meat, vegetabes, and etc, nobody will know, what hungry it is.

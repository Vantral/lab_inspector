Someone thinks that his peoples should eat only food which was made into their own country and trade this food for foreigners as little as possible. 
So, in my opinion, I think that eat only that food which was produced in our country, is a good way for people with their own production. Forexample, If you are a saller of potatoes or other vegetables, which you grew in your own garden, you will be able to have more money because of your bussiness. 
Also, if people will stop to buy products of other countries and will begin to use only domestic cultures in eating, it can help to decrease prices on food which was produced in our country. Forexample, if now many people begin to buy Russian cheese, the company of producing this product can have much more money because of it than if it would be not so many consumers but the price of the cheese would be higher. 
But, on the other hand, if the country will decide to produce only domestic food, the development of food's producing in the country will be not so fast as it could be if the country accepted different ways to produce food not only from their own companies. Forexample, countries can't specialize in all spheres of food because of their distinction and traditions. Therefore, they are needed to invite other countries to create a big space for different kinds of food. For instance, exotic fruit or special dishes as Spanish pizza. 
In conclusion I should say that to produce only domestic food is really important for development of buissenes of small domestic sallers but to be a power and interesting for tourists country, you should invite other countries to produce their own food in your country too.

These graphs shows the difference in maximum and minimum temperatures in Russian town Yakutsk and Brazil city Rio de Janeiro from January to December. 
It is clear, that the middle temperature higher in Brazil, than in Russia. The temperature of Yakutsk started in January, where maximum is -25*C and minimum -40*C, when in Rio de Janeiro at the same time maximum temperature is 30*C and minimum is 23*C. Besides, you can see, that at the top graph both lines rocketed to July and had a warmer weather there, while in Brazil the warmest weather was in January. In addition, graph of Yakutsk maximum and minimum temperatures started going down after July, but in Rio de Janeiro both lines fluctuated during all the period. Moreover, both graphs had start not at the same temperatures that in the end. 
In conclusion, I'd like to say that these graphs are very different, because the top graphs grew in July, when the second graph didn't have a really different temperatures during all time.

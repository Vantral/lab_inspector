There is an opinion, that each country should produce the food inside for people who live there and import only a small part of food. I absolutely disagree with this opinion, because it is very important for countries to export some production and import something that they need. Firstly, many governments try to earn enough money, so they should export something from their countries. It's kind of help them to became more strong and get many opportunities. Of course, if countries produce more food than their population eats, it could be very useful by economic side. Secondly, all countries can import food from the world, because some of them cannot produce something inside. There are a lot of reasons of this problem. For example, some countries don't have a good technology or buildings to prepare something. Another problem could be a small territory of this country. So, they should import all things that need, especially food. Thirdly, in many situations it can be very difficult to understand what production politic which country should use. All country in the world are very different. It means that they have different locations, goverments and, of course, population. And for some countries to produce the food, that need only their people can be an absoluttely mistake. To sum up, the opinion about food production only for countrie's population and small import is wrong. I think that it depends on the country, their opportunities, population and economic policity. Every government should know about their strong and weak sides and choose the best decision in each situation.

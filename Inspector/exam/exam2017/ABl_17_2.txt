Nowadays there is a wide spread opinion that piracy in media sphere is a crime, and people, who use illegal copies of films and music, should be punished. 
As for me, I cannot totally agree with such position. First, there are usually fixed amounts of money a person is ready to spend on different kinds of entertainments. If he is used to go to the cinema twice a month, he won't go there more often or pay for films at home, just because he isn't ready to spend so much money. Second, film makers now earn fantastic amounts of money by demonstrating their films in cinemas, and what about musicians, their main source of income is their concerts. So, there is no awful need for money for them. Third, if ordinary people are punished for piracy, their dissatisfaction will be much higher than dissatisfaction of authors, whose intellectual property is stolen. This is just because piracy has become usual in our country and it will be really hard for people to stop using such content. 
On the other hand, punishing for piracy can be beneficial for the whole media industry, as it will provide film makers and musicians with more resources. So, the industry is likely to develop. What is more, people will get used to respect intellectual property, what can be really beneficial for development of society. 
To sum up, there are some advantages of fighting against piracy, but there are much more disadvantages. It will be better to preserve current situation, as any probable changes may cause people's dissatisfaction and even protests.

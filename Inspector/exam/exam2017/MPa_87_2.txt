There is an opinion that people should produce the food only for country in which they live in and for the citizens of this country mostly. There are both pros and cons of these thoughts, but I am personaly concerned that this idea is not the best one. On the one hand, such situation can lead to the increasing of the level of people's satisfaction, which means that citizens will have all products they want to eat. Another point is that national trade will rise, and this is the one of the goals of many countries. On the other hand, such situation can make failed the whole economic position of this country. It must be said that in economy not only export plays big role but also import. In the case if an import will be as little as possible, which can be reason of the serious problem: some countries will not be the importer of some product, which the first country needs. Obviously, it must be mentioned that in different countries there are different climate conditions. In Russia, for example, the production of bananas and many other fruits is impossible, and to fill this "gap", Russia is in good economic relationship with Brazil and Morocco. This mean that the idea of making import as little as it can be can have a lot of negative effects. To sum up, production only for the population of one country and a decrease of the import have benefits, but also this have not positive effects. To my mind, it is much more better to produce the food not only for one population. Only the balance between import and export means the great level of the system of the economy.

It is widely considered nowadays that the only reasonable way to provide population with food is to limit its production so that only the small parts of food can be imported. Personally, I entirely believe that this situation should not be accepted. To begin with, such an opinion could appear in countries with a warm stable climate. However, it is failed to consider that only a small part of the world can have such a "facility". For the most of the countries it is often very difficult to support the land with a great amaunt of harvest due to the rains, dries or cold. Secondly, in case this policy would be accepted the problems with climatic changes would cause the bioengineers to produce GMPs which are very dangerous to the human's life as a consequence, a lot of diseases would kill a population of a country. In contrast, importing of food to other countries may establish strong international relationships. It would help to provide a nation with foreign products, which can be of a better quality, and, probably, would gain some knowledge to modernize agricultural techiques for national producers. Finally, it is very significant to remember that importing is a way to support national economy not only by foreign investments and profit from the sales but also by creating a competitiveness among national agricultural producers. For example, if Russia has a better fruits from Turkey, Krasnodar or Stavropol region will be triggered to uprgrade the techonologies and techniques to grow fruits of a better taste and quality. Bearing in mind all the above, the national government should think not only about producing food within a country but to have some for importing. I am totally convinced that food production should be for international perspectives as well.

People think that countries should produce only consumering goods and import level should be as low as possible. To my mind, this is very complex subject, so I am partly agree with this statement. 
On the one hand, it is very useful to produce the food that your population is consuming. It means the country become fully independent from the other ones. One of the important conseqence is that the economy of your country will be stable. This is important for every government. It also means that the country will not face such problems as lack of food, because the country only produces food. Fruits and vegetables from other countries can be the source of different diseases that can cause a calamity. 
On the other hand, people in such country will never taste products from other countries. Part of the population may dislike the native food. So they will have to relocate in to another country. By the way, import allow to improve technologies and educational level in the country. For example, the USA imports a lot of products and devices from the other countries and it is still one of the most powerful countries in the world. 
Finally, the opinion that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats is not clearly true. It has pros and cons as well. Limiting import will make the economy stable, but it also spoils the science and education and delete the possibility to improve the economy.

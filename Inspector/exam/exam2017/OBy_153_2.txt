There is an opinion that countries should make products that their own people consume and also should aim to lessen imported products. I do not agree this statement because in some countries it would make the lack of products. 
First and foremost it countries would produse food that their own people consume there will be no difference between consumable products in countries and this idea will not change list of products in these countries. 
Secondly, decrease of import products may has really bad impact on some countries. It may call the lack of products because these countries do not produce any food and whole amount of products is imported from other countries. If countries will try to exchange imported products by produced their people they will lose a lot of money and time. That makes this idea useless. 
In conclusion, I strongly believe that countries must not only import food but also produce it.

Nowadays countries are closely connected with each other due to the process of globalization. So for many of them import is more profitable for their economies, than self-production. Many people maintain that import should be minimal. And I completely agree with this point of view. If country is oriented on import, it loses its scores in developing economy and goods in such country are more expensive, and then in those who produced domestically. To begin with, countries, which are oriented on import don't need to produce their own domestic products, so they have a very high level of unemployment. And as a result there is no motivation to develop their own economy. For example, Russia imports many goods, so farming or other spheres don't develop at all. Furthermore, import goods are more expensive then those, which produced domestically. This is explained by high expendetures of transporting these goods or high taxation on import products. For example, there was a documentary program on TV several days ago. The truth statistics is that spending on transportation and taxation make import products third time more expensive than if they produced domestically. To sum up all the issues, I believe that the countries should develop their own production of domestic goods and reach high levels in developing their economies. As we can see, import should be as minimal as, possible, because it can help to avoid deep devision of the world and every country will get possibility to provide all people with jobs and money.

There is an opinion, that the country should provide their own population eat by themself and avoid import of food. Some people agree with this theory, some people disagree. There are some reasons for it. 
Some people think, that it is bad for the economy to import food. Russian people know that their country has enough resources to provide russians eats. It is possible to produce enough food, but nowadays the government pay not attention on food producing sphere. Don't let russian food sphere die. Russia can provide the hole world with food, if the government provides money thit part of russian economy. 
Another reason is competition between food producers. In case, if the country import the low price eat, the fermers from this country with more high price food cannot compete, and the economy of country dies. 
In the same time, there are people who think that it is good to import eat. For example, it is good for countries with difficult nature conditions, like Japan. The population of Japan is large, but there are not enough place to produce food. Besides, there are some fruits and vegetables, which can be not produced in all countries, but which are good for health. 
As for me, I think that countries need to produce the food for their own population as more as possible, but need not to forget about other needs: producing of clothes, machines, energy. I believe, that the change between countries is really good for economy. 
In conclusion I wanted to say that it is necessary to improve the producing of food inside the country. However it is important to communicate with another countries and to import and export goods.

These line graphs provide us with the comparison of average temperatures in Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
First graph illustrates that both average temperatures grow steadily through the 1st half of the year, rising from -35°C to 25°C for maximum and -41°C to 12°C. However, the trend is different for Brazil. The maximum temperatures here decreases from -30°C in January to 25°C in June. But minimum temperature rises through the first two months and falls till July. 
Period from July to December is connected with the slight falling of temperatures in Russia and rising in Brazil. 
The highest values of maximum average temperature for both regions have the similar number, 25°C in Russia and 30°C in Brazil. Moreover, the result is the same for minimum temperatures, 12°C and +17°C. 
The differences between maximum and minimum temperatures significantly change for each region, 60°C in Russia and only 5°C in Brazil.

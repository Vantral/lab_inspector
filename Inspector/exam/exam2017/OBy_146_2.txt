Some people believe that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible. To what extent do you agree or disagree. 
Today economic - one point of society. Every human need a lot of stuff (food, clothes, relax). All of this items - part of human consumption. But one of main problem - place, where produce items. Because external influence on economic of another country may be negative. In my way, where import have food positions, none positive influence at economics. 
At first - it is technology barter. At second stimulating homestik market. At third it is culture globalization.

Some people believe that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible. It is very popularn wiewn for many peoples. They think that it is very good for country, but I cann't agrree with them. 
First of all different countries have differen climate and cant grow some plants. We can't grow oranges or bannanas in the north, but he cant grow potatoes in the south. In the modern word we havenot problem with transport be tween countries, we can use trains in one continent, or ships between different continents and sell some food. For example Russia red fish in port fruits from Turkey, and export to them or we cant rise, but we can buy it in Chineese. However people want to eat different dishes, and they need for it different ingredients. Besides nort countries have winter, when they cant grow plants, but thei cam import it from sous countries. It very inportan for people, because we need vitamins to be healthier in cold winter, and we take it from tropic fruits from tropic contries such as Brasil or Moroko. 
More over inport and export is very inportant for economic at countries, for their friendship. Countries take money on costoms them import food. Also is important for politic between contries. 
When our government take more more from import, then take less more from people and thei will be happier. Hovever when contries produse more food for export thei have more work places for people. 
In my opinion this possteal is incorrect and I think that it is very important to import food, because we can export other food or other things and both contries will be happy. It is very important for world economics.

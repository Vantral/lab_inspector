It ridiculous to deny, that people make more and more use illegal drugs in professional sport. And some people says that sportsmen should be banned from professionally competing for limited period. Other believe, that such people should be banned for all live. I totally approve first point. First and foremost, the list of illegal gruds may change every day. Therefore should have time after additive of new drug in this list, because if persn use grugs and the goverment dramaticaly prevent access to these drugs, it may be reason for many illnesses of body and nervous system. Such person are able to be agressive. Sportsmen in such situation has all chance to end his sport carier. Other reason is that the list of illegal drugs is different in every country. And if sportsman use drug which is legal in the vast majority of contries, but is illegal in his nattive county, it is unlogical to banned from competing professionally for the rest of life, because many sportsmen from others countries are able to use this drug and take part in professionally competing. Third reason is that banned from competing profesionaly for all life is real serious punishment. Person, who have such punishment should be in depression and may not find another life style. To sum up, I strongly believe, ban from competing professionaly from a limited period is enough punishment for sportsmen, who use illegal drugs for several reason. And if we shoud banned such from competing professionally for the rest of life, we are able to broke their lifes.

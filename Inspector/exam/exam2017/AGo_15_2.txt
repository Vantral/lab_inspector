Nowadays many people think that the governments should decrease import to minimum and focus on production of food for their citizens. 
In my opinion, even though it is very important for the countries, it has a lot of disadvantages. 
First of all, if the population of the country is rather big, it is difficult to produce high quality food as the government will need to invest more money in order to achieve it. In the result, it will lead to products of bad quality that nobody will want to buy. For example, Russian chocolate is considerate to be worse than the chocolate produced in Europe. 
Secondly, if there is less import, there will be less competition for domestic companies. Import of products from other countries, usually stimulate domestic companies to produce better food in order make people want to buy it. For example, when "Oreo" was introduced to Russia, the same cookies from Russian company appeared shortly after. 
Thirdly, there are a lot of countries with limited resourses, meaning that people will not be able to enjoy good food or have a variety of it. For example, when foreign food was not important in Korea, Koreans could not eat meat a lot or buy milk and make cakes. With the introduction of foreign food Korean food market was broaden and Koreans began to produce their own cakes or milk products, that citizens are much eager to buy. 
In conclusion, despite the fact that all countries should aim at producing food for they population and minimalize import, from my point of view, such action has more negative sides as it can lead to the production of bad quality food, decrease in the competition for domestic countries and decline in the variety of food people can buy.

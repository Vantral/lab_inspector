People should to buy products very carefully and see in what country this product was produce, becouese usually import food is not naturaly becouse to transport food by one country to another people need a long time, but in this time food can't to be fresh and people to use different chemistry, which very dangerous for health every person and special children. Morover, import food it have highest cost than population eats. It important for many people because they economy their money. 
On the other hand, import is a good thing because there are some fruicts and vegetables which very difficult to produce in own population because it depend of climate. In this case countries need to help each others and their aim to import only fresh food. There are people which support this idea to import food not to aim to give money but to aim to have a good or tropic food, with they never can to produce in their own country.

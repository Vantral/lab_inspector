Today almost every country produce a lot of food for themselfs and for the export. But people thin that countries should not produce food for the export. 
From one hand it is better for economics inside the country to produce food and products only for their population, because it is support small businesses in that area and will improve them that in the future country could rise the whole economy. 
But from another hand some countries experts in one tipe of products and they sell this products to another country to buy different types of food. It call co-supporting (to help each others and they will help you). Because some countries cannot produce some food types because of climat or type of the ground and etc. Countries should cooperate with each other to support the stable economy. 
Furthermore it might help with economic inside the country to do less import and support their own produce of the food. I do not agree with this part of the staytment, because sometimes country just cannot produce fresh food for all population and it gives more import from another country to support them. 
In my opinion, countries should improve their economic inside by producing more food for themselves. I disagree that countries should aim to import as little as possible, because sometimes they can do this because of the climate or another difficulties. Countries should support each others.

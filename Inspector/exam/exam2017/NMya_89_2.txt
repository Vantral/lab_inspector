There are different opinions whether countries should import goods. Some people think that countries only need produce the food for their own population and should import as little products as possible. I disagree to this point of view. 
Firsty, import is very important to international economics. For some countries import is one of the main sources of income. For undeveloped and developing countries import is quite important - money which these countries get from import can be used for economical development. So, it makes import necessary for countries to work. 
Secondly, it is impossible for one country to produce all the food they need due to several various reasons. Some countries are just too small and they do not have enough land. Countries have different climat conditions and that affects to the amount and quality of the food they can produce. Rough climat in some countries does not allow to produce food at all. Also, in some countries climat conditions are not suitable for producing some types of food. Without import their choice of food will be limited. That is why import is necessary - it allows people to choose that they want to eat from the wide range of products. Moreover, import makes possible for people to buy in their countries exotic fruits and vegetables. 
In conclusion it is important to say that import is very important for all countries for various reasons. For some countries is is the way to survive and evolve, for others it is the opportunity to provide their citizens with all the food they need.

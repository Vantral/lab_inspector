Production of goods like food in some countries is a really controversial issue. Some people think that countries should produce such goods only for their own country and citizens, however others believe the countries need to participate the world area of trading. Personally, I partly agree with those who are not against of import and producing food that not only their own population consume. Firstly, as this issue connects with the globalisation, I think a lot of countries must specialize on their own products of food that they can produce easily and qualified and then find their niche in the global market. This strategy of two-sided export and import of countries will become much more beneficial for countries than being close to global market in producing their own culture food. Secondly, each country should be progressive in all industries and industry of food is not an exception. By producing new spectors of food country can begin a very popular tourist choice to go on vacation. Tourists from all over the world visit countries with their adorable food like for example, for pizza in Italy. If countries imports more goods and produces new food for people, there will be an economic growth and happier population, because of innovations in the country. However, I think that people must save their culture traditions and produce native foods forever, because no one will do this job better than native citizens. For example, usually only Italians cook their pasta as excellent as we know. in conclusion I want to add that there are several opinions about this topic of producing food and countries, and I really believe that importing and sharing food with other countries in global market is inevitable part of the beneficial survival of all population.

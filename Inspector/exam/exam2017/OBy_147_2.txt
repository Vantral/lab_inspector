Some people think that countries need to make food only for their citizen and don't import food for other countries. I disagree with that opinion. I think that countries should produce more foods and import it. 
Firstly, I think that import it is always advantage. Because, for the proced food, other countries pay some money to country which sells that food. Money is always benefit for contrie, due to that much money countrie has, the more improvements it can make. For instance, government can improve roads, build new houses for people or new medical centres, but for these government need money, and it can get it from import food. 
Secondly, all countries have different climat and different opportunities to produce some food. For example, in Russia it would be difficult to growth bananas. So it most easier to export from other countries. However, if all countries don't import foods, some countries stay without some food, and it is awful. People need various food, because from different food you can get more vitamins than from one type of food. Also some countries don't located near the sed, so they would't have fish, if all contrues import as little as possible. Some people say that fish is very useful product, and without fish some people can have ill. Also, if something happened, live big fire which destroy forest and many fields, countries which make more food than their own population eats, always have food, which it can't import and use in difficult situation. But if countries produce not enough food, then people can dying if many fields would be destroyed. 
To sum up, I want to say that countries should produce food not only for their own people but from import. Because all countries would have different food, and it is important for citizen health. Besides, countries would get much money due to they import food.

We would like to collect information from the chart representing the unemployment rate in selected world regions in 2014 and 2015. The first graph shows us the situation with North Africa in 2014-2015. We may conclude that they are similar as both are equal (both show the rate of unemployment of 12,5%). The second graf shows us the unemployment distributed among people of Middle East. The graph which shows us the situation in 2014 is bigger than another one representing the situation in 2015. The difference between them is 1,4%. The next two shows us the rate of unemployment in EU in selected years. The unemployment rate has increased for 0,4 - that is not really significant growth. The Latin American graphs are rather interesting as if shows as that unemployment in selected years in this region has decreased. The differences between two graph is 0,7%. The last two graphs shows us the case of South Asia. Two graphs are completely equal. Both are 3,9% precent. So, there is nothing to compare. The chart has one extra graphs summarizing the distribution of unemployment in the whole world. The mean of distribution is 5,9% comparing two graph. So, we may conclude that unemployment in the world has consistant distribution among regions.

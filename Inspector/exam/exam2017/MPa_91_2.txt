The problem of government, what they need produce and for whom, is controversial. So some people think that coutries should focuse on the needs of its citizens and try to produce all neccessary goods without import. But other people have an opposite point of view, that the governments have to pay attention to the comparative advantages and produce goods for export. Let's start to consider the facts. Firstly, the supporting local production can help farmers to expanse their business. In other words, if governments maintain and invest in production of local entreprenouns, that they don't have to waste money on transport's tariffs. As a result, it helps to increase the business of its own farmers. Secondly, when the governments concentrate on the comperative advantages and produce foods that its own population does not consume then there is a risks to have surpluse of products. Therefore, when the farmers have good harvest they can have an opportunity to trade with not only foreign consumers but also local demand. However, if a country make goods only for export they may have some undemanded goods. Nevertheless, there is the shortcomings in such point of view. For instance, the import give a chance to have diverce products in shops. Concerning the fact that not always people may grow or produce the relevant things due to the absence of necessary fasilities or conditions of nature. Consequently, the buying some products from other countries might bring more satisfaction to population. To sum up, it is controversial issue and I support the idea of production for own population because it has more positive sides.

The Internet helps us in a lot of cases and listening to music is not the exception for that. It is very comfortable to listen to your favourite musicians and it doesn't matter where you are. However, this process also has a negative effect. Now, it is really hard to fight with illegal copying and sharing of music. So, should the usage and production of pirate copies be considered as a crime and theft or not? 
First of all, let us consider the arguments of the supporters of such opinion. the main argument is based on the term "intellectual property". Some people think that music or film production is a very hard process that requires a set of skills and talent. So, when someone uses other people's music or films without the right to do that, he abuses other people's rights. That's why some people think that pirates should be punished. 
On the other hand, there are some people who disagree with this opinion. Mostly, they also support libertarian and anarchist political ideologies. Nevertheless, why do they support free copying and sharing of music? There are some reasons for that. One of the most important is that they think that music and films cannot belong to a specific person or a company. They say that music and films belong to the whole human kind. Also, these people think that this is against human nature to make money in such areas as music and movies. 
In conclusion, it is needed to say that the opinion given in the second paragraph seems more correct because each work should be paid. Another indicator is that the law of many countries is already protect music and film makers against pirates.

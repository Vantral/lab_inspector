There are many people that count that countries should produce food only for its population and try to import as less as they can. 
I am completely disagree with this statement, because nowadays many countries just cannot produce enough food, so they have to import one from other countries. For instance, African's and Arabic's countries, due to their climat, it is impossible to them reject other's countries food. 
However, many people may call science as solution for this problem, it means those counties should use modern agricultural technics to provide food. Also, people who support the idea of decreasing import, may say that it is dangerous then the amount of food depends on external countries' industry. 
When talk about modern agricultural it just hard to apply to Africans and Arabics countries dependencies it is not one-direction interaction, because Africans and Aabiccs countries which export food to them also depends from they oil production, And it is not more dependence, but something like cooperation. 
To sum up, there are no reasons to produce food only for countrie's production and decrease import. It is opposit, share and exchange recouces between countries usually cause positive effect.

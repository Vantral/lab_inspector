The Diagram illustrates the data for print and eBook sales in four countries in 2014, and their projected sales for 2018. Overall trends vary, however eBook markets in all four countries are expected to grow by 2018. In both the USA and the UK electronic books are expected to outsell printed versions by 2018, at 8.5 billion US dollars to 7.5 and 2.3 to 2 billion respectively. This is a significant change of around 20% on average from 2014, when print market dominated at 10.5 billion in the USA and 2.6 billion in the UK, which is 5 and 0.6 billion more than electronic book market in respective countries. On the other hand, chinese and german expectations for revenue in 2018 are relatively stagnant with 0 percent change in print revenue in Germany specifically, and almost an identical situation in Chinese markets. All in all, despite showing some amount of growth the eBook market is far from overtaking the print market by 2018 globally.

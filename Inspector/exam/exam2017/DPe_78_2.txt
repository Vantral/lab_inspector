Nowadays, the problem of media piracy became abnormally widespread. It is called one of the most important problems amond other problems that are related to privacy policy and information access on the Internet. However, even if this a problem wich authors face quite often, most of them earn a lot of mony with concerts they give. And the sum pirates can bit off from stealing someone's music cannot damage producor's or author's budget in that gros harmful way massmedia shows us. 
Actually, common citizens do not even know about piracy and how it affects on artsmen. They only want to get free content from Internet. In this case a problem is inside human's mentality. Unfortunately, not all of us are ready to show full respect to a property of another person. So, to solve this case, a clarification is needed, as much as a new strict law that can provide safety for authors. People must be told, how hard author's work is. Speaking about safety of data, we must remember it should be banished with an administration issues of the law. Maybe, the penalty money can serve a better idea - to find new projects from grate masters of Art. This must be counted as an option for users to support authors. As turned out, the public does not want to pay for musician's or writer's work, but also feels enraged when goverment tries to protect author's property. To provide more calm change from free on-line downloads to on-line purchases for music, we must pay attention to an hyperbolization of the amount of producer's lost money, but solve a problem softly and without rush. People must be prepared to new laws by social media or social advertisement wich shows the value of author's intellectual work.

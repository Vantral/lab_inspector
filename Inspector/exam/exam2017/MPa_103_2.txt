Each country has it's own local dishes and almoust every country produces it's own local food. Some people claim that it must be enough for population to eat only self-country-made products and borrow from other cultures almoust nothing. In my point of view it is wrong opinion. First of all, people should be possible to know something new about everything, especially about what is happening outside of the country they live. The least thing that the Government can do for it is importing the food of different cuisines from the countries where it mades. It makes people's minds wider and I think it is moustly important when somebody is thinking about leaving the own country, when he is in search for place to live. This factor can play a big role in chose. Of course, the Government of every country not interested in it's population going abroad. Bud despite on this fact I have got the reason why countries should produce more food than it's population can eat. A big part of world trades economics takes importing and exporting food. The countrie's Governments are making money by exporting food, so they have to buy and sell to make the system works. To sum up, I want to say that it is mistaken opinion to think that Governments should not import and produce big amount and viority of food. Do not they want to try and taste something Indian and Mexican spicey or something else?

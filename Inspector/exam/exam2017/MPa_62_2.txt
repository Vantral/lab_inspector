The age of globalization has come, introducing a large number of debatable issues, including a food sustainability question. Food sustainability proponents claim that each country should cater for its internal consumption requirements rather than import foods. Their antagonists state that in the world of global economy it is impossible to only concentrate on domestic food demands. I personally fully agree with the latter viewpoint: food imports are a unalienable part of a successful economy. To start with, not all countries are able to provide their population with a wholesome diet. For instance, countries like Brazil or Thailand originally grow only exotic foods, including citrus fruits or coffee. It is evident that these countries have to import some kinds of meat and dairly products. Moreover, countries with colder climate, for example, Canada or Russia, cannot grow many kinds of fruit and vegetable that people eat on a daily basis. Thus, the only way for these countries to supply its citizens with necessary products is to bring them from abroad. Finally, there are also developing countries whose agricultural level is not sufficient to fulfil the food requirements of the whole population. For instance, many African countries have to rely on importing foods to feed their people. To conclude, I firmly believe that there are cases where importing foods is absolutely necessary. These cases include inappropriate climate or technological underdevelopment.

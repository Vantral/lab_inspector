The given chart provides the information about unemployment rate in various world regions in 2014 and 2015. We can see that there is no big differences in one region in two selected years. In 2014 the leader of the number of unemployment is Nothern Africa. In Africa there is approximately 12,5 per cent of unemployment. This number stayed stable, so in 2015 there is also 12,5 per cent of unemployment. Next to the leader is Middle East withe 11 per sent of unemployment in 2014. But this number decreased, so in 2015 there is 9,6 per cent. The only region, where the percentage of unemployent has rised, is EU. The percentage has rised from 7,5 to 7,9 per cents. We also have region where the numbers stayed stable and quite low. It is South Asia, where the percentage is 3,9. If we look at worldwide results it would be quite surprising, because it is quite low, only 5,9 per cent of unemployed. The worldwide result is made of different region's results, so it is much lower than, for example, in Nothern Africa.

There is no doubt that copying and sharing films or music on the Internet is illegal. There are people who use illegal sites and methods. Others would like to punish such people and think it is a theft. 
To my mind, the Internet is a huge unreal location for crime. Downlowding music, films and other types of media is illegal nowadays. What is more, we should not forget that special part of our society lose huge amounts of money because of pirate copies. These people do a really hard work producing films or music. This business is their work and they get money for it. Why does it allow to get their work and money bock? I consider, we have to punish people who download some files for free and using illegal methods. We should appreciate hard work of media-sphere. 
Some people wouldn't like to support my position because they use illegal methods by themselves. These people think that Internet is a free zone for everybody. They don't understand why they cannot use some sites with music or films. It is normal situation and we just have to explain them about some author's rights and pirate copies. We should not forget about punishments. If you copy or share music or films on the Internet, you have to pay fee or sometimes it can be more strict punishment. 
To sum up, I would like to say that Internet is a free zone but with boerders. If you don't know these boarders and allow yourself to do what you want, you should be punished.

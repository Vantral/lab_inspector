This issue is the vital part of the modern life. Although many people prefere to copy or to share music and films on the internet instead of buying its, the cost of this has to be considered first. 
Many people support the opinion that it is very bad situation, that all people have a free access for different sources in the internet. Firstly, musicians and film producers, who make efforts for to do music or film, should get the goods for its works. It could be illustrated by the following example: a producer make a film and he wish he is respected and he want to have money for his hurt job, but people don't want to buy the disc with his film, they copying it on the internet. As the result a producer lose money. Secondly, producing and making music are the work and its work is same as other jobs. For instance, if an economist or people, who seat the governmental office have the goods for jobs, musicians, producers artist should also get money. 
However, some people think that it is normally situation in the modern life and musicians and film producers should understand, that they can't evide loosing goods. Moreover, it isn't right to punish such people because they act rationally, when they don't want to buy for free music and films. 
Having considered both sides of this debate, it can be concluded that it is spead situation in the modern world, when people share or copy films or music, but we should think about musicians and film producers, who lose huge money and we should solve this issue. Personally I would agree with the idea that we should destroy the process of making illegal pirate copies, because it make a harm for people, who make the art and want to get money and respect for efforts.

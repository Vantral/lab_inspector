Nowdays pirates are not, who burglar ships and kill sailors, it is people who steal music, films, books or something like this in the internet. But there is a question if they should be punished. 
It is obivous that people, who earn money from legal products, want people, who download or share pirate copies to be punished, as it's illegal. Every country has speacial laws to protect authors from stealing their works. 
To my mind, there should be such prohibitions only on works, which author is alive, because there a lot of companies who have the author rights to works of dead people, and they forbid to share the music or books even if the author wasn't mad at such sharing. Sharing books can rise the level of education of people, and this is one of the proses of pirates. 
Nowdays there are a lot of web sites, where you can watch films legaly, but you have to watch the advertisment first. The advert brings huge money, so the authors can earn money. In my opinion such way is the most appropriate to develop industry of music or cinema. Those want to watch a film or listen to music shouldn't pay money for it. Art should be free. 
I also disagree with the opinion tha producers lose a huge money because of the pirates. There are always someone who wants to buy a legal product so they spend money for it. Othervise someone just don't have money for such entertainment, so they use pirat copies. But the money, which producers get from their popular works are always huge.

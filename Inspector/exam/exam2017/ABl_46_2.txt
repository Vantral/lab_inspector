The robbers always were a class of people who never get a support of society in public: everyone understand its kind of bad things to take stuff which belongs to somebody when you have no right for it. Actually, twenty first centuary changed world around: you now don't need to steal original discs because everyone can get access to them on internet for free. So is it the rule of new reality we all should accept or pirates should be punished for copying films and music? 
On the one hand, we all understand that in modern world making music and films often is all about money. Authors spend a lot of recources for studios, actors, marketing and so on, and they have a right to get their investment back with some kind of payment from society. And in this model, internet is a factor which blocks a huge amount of sales because some part of films and music auditory prefers to get this content for free and forgets about payment to creators. While this happens, authors get less money than they could, so there is less motivation for them to create new interesting content. In this way of thinking it looks like we should say "yes, we need to punish pirates". 
But from the other side, we should understand that the process of customer's decision making is pretty difficult. People don't want to spend money for thing they are low informed about, but when we, for example, get possibility to listen some musician for free, it's easier for us to make decision about buyin tickets at his concert. So, free content may be a part of business. 
As for me, we can do nothing with fact that internet changes markets, so content creators should learn how to change their models of monetisation and make them more suitable to the modern world. So if people don't want to pay for music, we should check, for example, if they are ready to pay for ways to listen it with comfort (like Apple music for iPhone). Creators need to do their suggestion to customers more complexe. Or die.

Nowadays there are a lot of discussions about whether importing food effects the countries in a positive or negative way. A lot of people argue that import should be almost avoided while others claim that it is essential. In this essay I will present my own point of view and illustrate it with the examples. 
Personally, I believe that import of products is not bad and that it influences the economy of the country in a positive way. Firstly, usually a country is not able to produce enough food for all the population. It is mainly connected with geographical reasons. For example, in Korea, where there are a lot of mountains everywhere, there is not enough space for raising cows and other animals. This means that meat and milk need to be imported from other countries. 
Secondly, import and export develop the economy of the country. According to the statistics, food is one of the most frequently bought and sold items in terms of international trade. Usually the economy of the country is based on import and export. There is a common situation when a country produces much more products than needed and export affords getting additional income to the country's budget. 
Last but not the least, importing and exporting products is a part of international trade which strengthens international relationships between countries in general. Many experts argue that it is an important reason not to elliminate import. 
In conclusion, although some people believe that producing the food only for the needs of the population of the country is the best option, I am sure that it is not possible and economically effective. In my opinion, import of food is essential as it positively influences the economy and prevents lack of food inside the country.

It is often said that countries that countries should avoid importing foood and produce it for their population. That point of view is sane, and I mostly agree with this meaning, but only with some remarks. 
First of my arguments is that producing is usually cheaper than buying so it is good for economics not to import food, but make it. The government that is not buying expensive food from another countries can spend the money for enhansing the level of people's life or improving scientific researches. 
Secondly, in case of conflict with countries exporting food, the importing country will have a deficite. People will lose some of their favourite product because of shopping the import. But if the country is not buying food, but making it, a deficit will not happen. And it is not just about food, but firstly it is medicine and weapon. 
However, there is one problem that lies in possibilities. Countries just cannot produce every kind of food on their own. Sometimes the climate or another things just forbid to produce food. For example, it is impossible to grow bananas or pineapples in cold north countries. I think we should nesessary mention it, because if we do not import some rare kinds of food, then people start to miss it and become unhappy. 
In conclusion, I want to say that it is not true to provide radical meanings as complete avoiding an import.

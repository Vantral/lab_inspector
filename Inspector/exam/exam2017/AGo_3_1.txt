Two line graphs represent the information of average months temperature in Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
According to the first graph information the temperature in Yakutsk hits a peak in July and the difference between the minimum and maximum ones is about ten degrees. However in Rio de Janeiro the highest temperature rates are in January and February and the difference is only six or seven degreed. That case can be explained by geografical positions of both cities. 
The line charts are also show that in Yakutsk the temperature is below zero for seven months, while in Rio de Janeiro the lowest temperature is slightly less than twenty degrees. There is another difference between two graphs. In Yakutsk the temperature is rapidly rise from February to July and then falls down with the same speed, as in Rio de Janeiro it only has a little decrease in June and July. Nevertheless, average difference between maximum and minimum temperatures is lower in Yakutsk. 
In conclusion, the graphs clearly represent the temperature difference in two cities: the temperature in Russia is obviously more unstable and lower than in Brazil.

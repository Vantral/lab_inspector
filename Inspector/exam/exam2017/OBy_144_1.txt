On this graphs we can see the average temperature values in two cities. The first chart describes highest and lowest temperatures in Yakutsk, and the second one shows the same parameters in Rio de Janeiro. Generally, both graphs demonstrates that minimum and maximum temperatures have the same trend for each city: highest and lowest values rise and fall together. 
But in Yakutsk we can see that in summer months middle maximum and minimum values are situated in their highest position. From this point of view second chart is more passive: average temperature values in winter and in summer are very close to each other. The reason of this difference is geographical position. Rio de Janeiro is situated close to the equator. The is why the angle of Earth, which is different in summer and in winter makes no sence to the temperature in this city.

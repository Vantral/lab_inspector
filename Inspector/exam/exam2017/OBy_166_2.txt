Modern technologies changes our life, it becames faster and easier with them, but new problems appear and significant part of them are related to health. This essay states some examples of that diseases, explains the reasons of their appearance and give recommendation how to decrease the negative influence of modern technology. 
To begin this talk about problems caused by technologies, the ecology must be reminded. Today science has plenty of studies how to improve ecology and care about it, but harmful technologies still used and appear again. Also modern gadgets are weaking the human's eyes, headphones - their hearing, microwaves, which are going from every electronic machine, destroy neurosystem and cardiosystem of our body. Technologies also sets modern lifestyle, whice remains sitting work or running fast and eat unhealthy food, Of course cars are one of the from prospects of modern technology, and they often became a reason of deads in car encidents. 
In that case the reasonable question "what can we do?" must be answered. I think the positive effect of modernization is less than described above negative effects. Not only physical health are weakened, our principles and values were changed and cursed. We must return to our traditions, and which is most significant - to our religion. It is a spiritual state, it is that united thing, which we must protect, because if we lost it, our society will be defeated. 
To sum up, we could not developing without problems and it is too difficult to reduce it, so we should stop and go back to traditions and to church. It is not the only correct decision, but it should work if we scared to developing by side negative effects which could appear.

In current day and age, politics and government structures have changed drastically from the previous century, rendering some countries almost unrecognizable from before. Many historical events such as wars make governments think more about their economy and overall supplies. One factor of this equation is food. Some people believe that their country only needs to produce the food that their own population eats and shouldn't import as much, or at least aim to import as little as possible. There are many opinions on this controversial topic. 
From one perspective, some people may claim food production an expensive means of supply, requiring costs in both time and money, however making local production to be a first priority goal because doing so strengthens the economy by providing working places with an additional patriotic bonus. Furthermore, creating own food provides a sustainable resource while being independent from third parties or other countries. 
On the other hand, experts claim that political influence is neglible compared to immense benefits food importing provides. First of all, your working class becomes free (at least partially) from one duty being constant and reliable food supply, thus creating opportunities for more expensive industries. Moreover, political relationships are more positive than negative with the result being mutually benefitial deals between countries that can excessively produce food, and those who can not. 
All in all, this is a controversial question to be answered differently by every country. In my opinion, importing should be generally preferred because among all, it also benefits customers, and sometimes, the positive effects of economic trade deals become visible by the general population, reflecting in its well-being.

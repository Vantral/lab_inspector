Nowadays profissional athletes often use illegal drugs as dopping. Some people are sure that they should not take part in competition during some period (eg 2 years), while others believe that they should be punnished for the rest of their lives. Both point of views are valid and worth considering before a definite conclusion. It is ridiculous to deny that sportsmans, who consume illegal drags should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period, for example several years. If drugs influence not stronge on health of the athlet, than person can return into sport and continue his activity. On the other hand, there is no denying that sportmens, who use strong illegal drugs should be punished for the rest of their lives. First and foremost, they lie other athletes and they achived their results unlawfully, there fore such people should be punnished on the period more than fewer years. It is useless to deny, that punishment for the consumption illegal drugs is addicted to components, which are used for production of preparate. If athletet uses the drugs which is very harmful for his health, he uses there illegal drugs everytime, then he should be banned for the rest of their lives. However if athletes understood that he made mistake and he don't want to consume these illegal drugs, then in this situation he shoul be punnished on the fewer years. It is my firm convinient, that organisators should pay attention for checking of health of athletes and they should be punished for the use of illegal drugs individually.

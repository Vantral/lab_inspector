Nowadays almost all countries take a part in international trade. Some countries increase their benefit due to export like Japan, others against import necessary food and products because of lack of natural resourses or good conditions. Some people think that it is normal to import a lot from other countries. However, I think that every country should produce food and service by their own and import only in some cases. Firstly, it is obvious that when countries import some food or products their price is very high and unavailable for the majority of habitats. For example, our country have fertile lands but do not growth neccesary amount of potatoes. That is why our government have to import potatoes from other countries like Belarussia for bigger price while the price of one kilogramm is nine roubles. Secondly, when countries import products they pay a lot of money for them to other countries and decrease the amount of CDP in their own country. This topic is closely connected with unemployment as when country decides to produce something it needs extra workers. Thus, chiness produce almost everything from modern gadgets to socks and level of import in China is very low. Extended production lets them to provide citizens with necessary food and services, create extra workplaces and increase the amount of CDP in their country. To sum up, I want to say that it is really import for countries to produce foods and products without import as only independent countries can reach high level of development, life and prosperity.

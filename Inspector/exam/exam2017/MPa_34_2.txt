Nowadays there are some countries that consume only goods they produce themselves. Governments of other countries consider that this method is economically uneffective. In this essay I try to explain you my point of view, and why I think that countries should export different goods, if they can. Firstly, thanks to globalization many countries can import something necessary for them, and change it to things, that they export. In this case, both sides will have their own benefits. For example, now in Russia it's possible to buy exotic fruits from Morocco, and this is good for economy of Morocco. Secondly, for many countries it's impossible to survive in our modern world, because they haven't got important and necessary resources, for example oil, gas and even water. Some countries in Africa can exist only because they sell fish, fruit and other primitive goods. If they didn't do it, they would disappear from our planet without help from other developed countries that change their natural resources to goods, which African countries can export. To sum up, it is clear that countries shouldn't aim to import as little as possible, because the change of goods between countries improves the level of life of citizans in both countries in all cases.

Many people saying that there is a big problem with illegal pirate copies with music and films. Musicians and film makers are losing a lot of money from this type of coping and sharing without official buying the original discs. So the idea is that people who downloading illegal copies from the internet should be punished. 
Every human on our wold has their own property right if wants so. And when somobody creates anything he has the right to sell it to other people. From these point of view, making illegal copies is a really bad thing, because after this musicians and film producers might not be able to create anything again in case they are run out of money. Some people said that there would be much more art, films and music if everyone honest support creaters and buy legal cop. That's why people who download illegally should be punished. 
On the other hand, the direct effect of punishing people to prevent buying illegal copies would be opposite from "more good art, films and music". It is clear that not every film and music in our world is a great piece of art, because sometimes the only purpose for producers and musician is to make more money. So, when nobody knows is that film good or bad and they need to buy it or they would be punished doesn't provide good cuality produc. The idea of this point of view is that people should only support creators if they like produc. They can go to the cinema to watch the film they liked or buy legal copy of music disk. In this way only good produc would get a lot of money and make our world better. 
To sum up, this is very complicated problem. Better solution would be the right to people to deside by themselves do the want make their produc with property licence. In this case people would get time to pay for produc and after some time try it free in the internet, because internet is not belong to anyone.

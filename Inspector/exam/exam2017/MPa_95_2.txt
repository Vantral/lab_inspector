Since the middle of the 20th century, when the world has faced globalization, countries need to pay more and more attention to the global trade. Though some people believe that a country should support its producers produce a sufficient number of goods for country, I don't think that replacing import will help the nation in any way. First of all, it is rational to import some goods because of the cost of production, that depend on the environment, laws and so on. For example, it doesn't seem to be logical to start growing bananas in Iceland. A country can build up a factory with conditions that are required, but the costs will be too much. More than that, the production of some goods requires specialists, that a country can employ, as the global market exists. But the results of such an experiment are unpredictable. It happens with Russia now. The country tries to replace the import, but it doesn't have enough resourses for it, including human resourses. As a result, there are some of russian smartphones that nobody buys. Some of the people can argue, that investing money in import substitution needs some time. It is a long-term investment, but the benefits will cover the costs. Still, there is no evidence, that there will be any benefits at all, because nobody can predict the future but the amount of money, that substitution needs is enormous. To sum up, replacing import seems to be way too risky investment. The cost is too high and the benefits are not certain. I believe, that countries shouldn't go against the nature of the market.

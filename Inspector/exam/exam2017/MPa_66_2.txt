Nowadays, some people sure that states only need to produce the food that own population eats. Also these people consider that countries should aim to import as little as possible. Is it a good or wrong idea? To begin with, I don't agree with this idea. Firstly, when a country sends some products to other country, it can be a big advantage of the development of economic relationships. Only country has a chance to increase its base budget, while other can simply get goods of high quality. For example, such type of connection can be seen by Russia and Egypt. As a result, population of Russia has a possibility to eat good and tasty oranges. In this way, Egypt increases the level of the economy. As we can see, it is really useful and important relationship and for Russia and for Egypt. Also import can play a big role in helping other countries. Today Ukraine has a big problems with goods of first aid because of the conflict between Eastern and Western parts of the country. So, there is a fact that Russia helps and supports the population of Ukraine by sending food and other kinds of food to the country. Besides, it is famous fact that Africa is a poor country. And many governments take part in helping this continent. On the other hand, it is important to look at the helping to other countries from a negative side. In a partical, there is a tendency that latest years the main budget of Russia decreases. It is connected with such point that the country has a big import policy today. Government tries to give any help to Ukraine that this country will go out from the difficult economic state. In conclusion, I would like to say that it is really important to import different kinds of goods that to have relationships with other countries and develop economic connections of a country. Besides, it is simply necessary to give a finance helping to other countries if they need it.

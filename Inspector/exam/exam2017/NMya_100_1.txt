The graphs below represent the information about goods' transportation between East European countries in 2008. 
It is seen on the chart, that the percentage of machinery transported by rail is six time bigger than the percentage of the same good transported by road. Despite that, transportation of food products is more preferable to be done by road (30%) rather than by rail (11%). Moreover, road is used twice more for transportation of non-metallic minerals. However, metals are likely to be transported by rail. 
But, on the other hand, there are some similarities in figures. The percentage of transported manufactured goods almost equals on the two charts. The same situation is seen with transportation of chemicals. Transportation by road is only five percent bugger than transportation by rail. 
Overall, the charts below show, that both ways transportation of goods are extremly popular. But one of them (by rail) is more used for metals' transportation, whily road is more used for food transportation.

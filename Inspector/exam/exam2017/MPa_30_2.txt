In the modern world, humans' health play quite an important role. And, nowadays some people consider that athletes, who use illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally for a certain period, for example, for 2 years. At the same time, other people think that such athletes should be banned forever. On the one hand, sportsmens, who consume illegal drugs have a very worse health. Because, drugs are very harmful even if them can increase your forces. In addition, athletes, who take drugs are usually have many problems. Also, it is very dishonest because other sportsment have not this big force. On the other hand, if athletes, who take drugs will be banned forever, then they will cannot compete with other in the future. So, they can doing exercises in their home or other places, but only for yourself. I think that this proposal is very strict for athletes, because they can change one's mind through some period. I consider that we should give a limited period to those sportsmens. Thus, in this period, athletes can understand what they have made a big mistake in their life. So, in conclusion I want to say that people, who think that the sportsmens should be banned for a limited period, are right. Moreover, I think that we should give such athletes the second chance. But if they lose this chance and through some time athletes will take illegal drugs again, then they will be banned forever.

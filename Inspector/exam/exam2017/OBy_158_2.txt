There is a thought that countries should produce food only for their own consumption and reduce imports as much as possible. In this essay I will analize the topic and give my opinion. 
First of all, there are many different countries in different parts of the world. Thus, in some places the climate and other environmental factors play a huge role in the country's ability of producing food. For example, countries with warm weather tend to import a lot of vegetables and fruits because there is more than enough for the country itself. 
Secondly, it is important for countries to import food as it can be helpful for gaining budgets and keeping the economy safe and stable. For example, slightly developed countries such as India and Turkiye depend on imports a lot. 
Thirdly, if there was no import at all, the variety of food you see in most of the grocery stores would be so small that there would be deficit in some products, which could lead to overpricing. 
On the other hand, if the country relies only on its own production of food and can maintain good living standards, then having little imports could be very beneficial as it's economy cannot fluctuate because it's less dependan on the food market. 
To conclude, I personally thin that it is great for some countries to have minimal imports if they are able to maintain in decent living standards. But the reality shows that having imports is crucial for most of the countries. That is why producing food and importing a part of it is more important.

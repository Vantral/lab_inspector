First of all, it is clearly obvious that these cities are located in different climate zones. For example, there aren't monts with negative temperature at all: the lowest temperature ever was noticed in July (approximately 17°C), as well as people of Yakutsk suffer from severe colds every winter because in December and January there is extremely low temperature - from -35°C (maximum) to -40°C (minimum). Also we can notice that period from June to August is the warmest one for Yakutsk and the coldest for Rio de Janeiro. But levels of temperature looks quite the same. In July these towns even have the same maximum - +25°C, but minimum for Rio de Janeiro is higher by approximately 5°C. Furthermore, we can see that directions of average temperatures change in July in these cities: after August in Yakutsk the temperature decreases to its minimum and in Rio de Janeiro increases to its maximum (+30°C in December). Also, in Rio de Janeiro there isn't such a big difference between the highest and the lowest level of temperature - not more than 10°C, when in Yakutsk this number is almost 20°C, explanation of this phenomenon is also different climate zone, which is more unpredictable that the zone where Brazilian city is located.

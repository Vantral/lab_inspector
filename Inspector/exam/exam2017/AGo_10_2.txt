Recently there is an active discussion about whether should the countries support the policy of protectionism or should the markets be remained opened to the world. 
In my opinion, due to the prosecc of globalization, the inner economies of every country undoubtly go global, and it is impossible nowadays to ignore the interests of other states. First of all, almost all countries are connected in a common commercial net in order to devide labour and production facilities. Most of the times one isolated country cannot produce enough various food to feed it's citizens. That is why it imports needed products from the abroad and exports the goods that can be provided to other countries. Secondly, it is impossible to limit an import without cancelling an export. Export is a way to gain money and to fulfill a national budjet. Rejecting the worldwide standarts can cause the crisis inside the country in case. People won't get enough food and obviously will be unhappy with the actions of the couvernment. Thirdly, worldwide help providing is also extremely important. Some states, in Africa, for example, will not be able to survive without the material economic help from developed countries. 
In conclusion, it is necessary to agree that sometimes the policy of protectionism can be useful. However, it should have its limits, because worldwide connections are essential nowadays.

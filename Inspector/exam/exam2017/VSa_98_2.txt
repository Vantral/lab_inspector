In our modern sport field it is a widespread tendenton to using illegal drugs before the competition. Some people believe that athlets who was identified as taking dopping should ban from competing for a period. However, others say that such athlets breake the rools and they should be banned from training at all to the end the life. 
In my opinion, one unnormal step such as taking drugs is not a point to take him or her away from competition for the long period of time. Firstly, such beheaviour might be connected with the willingnes of be the winner of the one competition. Sportsmen train all their life to have the first place at world competition or in the Olympic Games, for example and taking drugs for such athlet is not a repeated tendendensy, but the only not right step. 
Secondly, the athlet might be against such methods, but the coach, for example, might pressure on the sporsman to take additional tablet. Dopping is not always the desision of athlet and this case should be included in the punishment. 
Nevertheless other people argue that if person take the wrong way first time would be and the second time. Such people believe that in competition there is always a big temptation to breake the rools and if sportsman do it, he or she must go out from the sport. 
I have to disagree with that idea and say that taking drugs by athlet may be a nessesary step because of the health condition. In professional sport it is not an exeption that athlets broke legs or arms and they must to train despite the pain. Only helpful and important medical tablet could be presented too district commision as a dopping. 
To sum up, I would like to say that the situations and conditions when sportsmen decide to take drugs to win competition or to be just stronger are very different. And it is important to give people a chance not to loose the profession.

The first line graph depicts the typical highest and lowest temperatures in Yakutsk from January till December. The second line graph provides information about maximum and minimum temperatures in Rio de Janeiro for the year period. 
Considering together, figures suggest the negative correlation in terms of the temperature rate in both cities, but it was not consistent. 
It can be seen that in Russia the gap the average maximums and minimums appered to be different, depending on the month. The typical difference in temperatures for Yakutsk was just about 10°C in July, when it was a peak, while in December it contracted to only less than 5°C. In contrast to that, in Rio de Janeiro the difference between temperatures was consistent during a period, being about 10°C. 
When compared together, it is clear that the temperatures, maximums and minimums, for both of the countries changed during a year but they followed different patterns. Turning to Yakutsk, the temperatur significantly grew stadily to the middle of summer and than declined, following quite a simmilar pattern. When it turns to Rio de Janeiro, the change in temperature was not as dramatic as it was in Russia. In addition, when temperature reached a peak in Yakutsk, it turned to the lowest point for Rio, 20°C and 10°C to 20°C and 25°C respectively.

There is no doubt that nowadays there is a tendency to use illegal drugs in sports competitions. There are different attitudes about this statement. 
On the one hand, Some people believe that athletes caught using this substances should be banned for 2 years. There are some benefits of this opinion. To start with, if athlete do not know about different substances included in his meal, he will return in sport after 2 years period. For instance, we should not blame Maria Sharapova for using drugs (such as "mildoniy"), as it was included in her medcine. Moreover, people who would like to use drugs should know that there is a panishment to prevent them do it. Finally, although some athletes think that using drugs there is no any impact on their health, it is proven by scientists that such substances influence on people's coordination, heartbeat and breathing. So the rule will probably prevent athletes from using drug and it will be beneficial for their health. 
On the other hand, there are lots of people who claim that athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. Mostly such opinion is discussed among athlets. They do not want to compete with people who has been banned previously. Moreover, some people think that 2 year panishment is not really strict. 
However, in my opinion, to ban athletes forever is not moral. As I said previously, sometimes they do not want use drugs by themselfs. Although they should be punished, the discvalification for the rest of the life can cause mental diseases and uncertainty. 
To sum up, I strongly believe that thereis an issue of using drugs nowaday. However, we should prevent the production of these drugs and their distribution but not punish people forever. The 2-year period is enough to understand your mistake.

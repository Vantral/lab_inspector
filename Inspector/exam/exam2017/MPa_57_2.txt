Nowadays, many people claims that countries should aim to import as little as possible and produce the food that are their own population eats. This essay is disagreed with the staitment. There are some reasons for it. Firstly, import and export became a great important part of economy in modern world. Every developed country has many traid contacts and it helps countries to communicate. It is normal for countries to produce some food for other countries. It helps to make the choice wider So people can have some dishes which their own country cannot produce for some reasons. Import and export of food for our world and countries is like a conversations for people - without it, it will be really hard to live. Secondly, import can be really helpful for country's economy. If country produces only first need products, there always will be people, who wants some delicious, maybe rare food. And the restaurants, for example, can import such kind of food and put high price on them so people, who are going to pay for it, will help restaurant business to grow. Also when country import some food the government can put higher prices, so they will be willing to earn more money for the country. Overall, it is really tricky question, and it is hard to give some arguments for agreement or disagreement with the thesis statement. In my opinion, countries should import as much as they want to and they don't need to produce food only for their own population. It is up to country's decision, economy politics and resources that they have.

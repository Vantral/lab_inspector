The Internet has changed our life a lot. But it gave us not only new oportunities, but also new problems. One of them is pirate copies. Nowadays a lot of people copy and share music or films on the Internet, that is why some musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money. But in my opinion, we should not punish people, who download these files. 
First of all, the era of the original discs has gone. This is the past and we can not change it. What I mean by this is that nowadays it is impossible to make people buy discs and not to downoload music and films from the Internet. This is the new part of our reality and not the crime. Secondly, artists can also have some benifits using free access to their products. For example, it can help them to be more popular, to have bigger amounts of fans. For example, I will not pay for CD of unknown for me musician, but if I can listening to song free, I can like him and then buy CD or go to the concert. Moreover, the idea of punishing people, who download files from the Internet can be hard become a reality, because it is really difficult to control this space (Internet). For instance, there are some services that can be find only people, who have special key or something like this. 
To sum it up, I would like to underline, that in my opinion, the idea that copying and sharing musics or films on the Internet seems to me the idea of the past.

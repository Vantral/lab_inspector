Nowadays there are a lot of new and interesting films are made and there are many music bands are organised. In that case a great amount of content, which is recommended to be seen, is getting created every day in cultural industry. With the new technologies some people can made illegal copies of them so the others can download them. I totally disagree that people who share and download these files should panished. 
First, songs and films can be named as cultural objects so it would be unfair to panish for sharing it. I suppose that these pieces of culture was made to share some ideas with society and the creators did not think about the money firstly. 
Second, there are a lot of people who can not allow themselves to spend too much money on these things. The prices on disks with music and films are getting bigger every year. So if there is an objective to become popular and well-known all over the world because of the talent of creators it will be sad if their dreams will not come true just because of high prices and peoples' disability to pay for it. 
Third, if more people will know about these musicians and films producers, some day they can get profit from it. For instance, they can become sponsored by rich people or company with great influence on society. 
To sum up, people who share and download these files should not be panished because there is a big probability that they make a great implicant in creators' success.

Nowadays there are a lot of pirate copies of music and films made illegaly can be found on the Internet. The authors of the ideas lose money they could earn without pirate activity. I suppose that any kind of crime is to be punished and making illigal copies obviously is a sort of theft. Some thoughts about this topic will be given below. 
Firstly, pirate coping is an exlusive crime, though it is still a theft. If casual thefts are charged and punished, I see no reason why people who make pirate copies of music or films can avoid punishment. They all brake the law about the property. Only the producers of music an films have the right to spread their works. It is wrong to ignore the author's rights and let people who do it unpunished. 
Secondly, people, who use and download pirate files are guily in crimes too. They buy goods illegaly and consume something that is prohibited. They can also spread this music or films among their relatives, friends which means that the illegal action can hardly be stopped. I believe that it is absolutely wrong and can not be allowd. Punishment is a mean that can affect the number of crimes. Not only people who provide others with pirate copies must be punished but also those who help them to success. 
Thirdly, pirate copies are the spoilde versions of the originals. People make the art wors than it must be. I believe that is wrong too. Therefore there is one mane reason to prevend pirate activity. We lose something that art serves to. Original version have better quality, but pirate files are like broken glass. I think it is like drowing in books. We can read the text, but it is hard to get the same pleasure from reading when shirts are not good enough. 
Overall, not only the money is the reason for punishing people who make pirate copies and for thouse who consume them, but the respect for the original too.

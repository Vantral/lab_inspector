Nowadays we can see a lot of pirate sites in the Internet that gives everybody possibility to see the films and listen to the music without paying any fee. As it make film and music making companies lose their money, it should be punished. And I completely agree with that. 
First of all, it ruins the limitalions for watching or listening the content that can be found in this kind of Internet sourses. For example, as the film that is broadcasted in the sinema has limitations to the age of watchers, all the parents could be shure that their children under the age of 18 would not see any content that may hurt them. And so on with the music. But the pirat sites gives accesss to all kind of content even you are too young. 
And of course huge loses of broadcastening companies are the big problem because they do their job and they should be payed for it. And the illegal copies stops people from going to the cinema or buying new music disc. So, it may make the film and music companies stop to provide new films and songs of high quality or it may destroy all the industry of broadcasting and producing music and films. Consequently, all the sphere of making this king of amusement will suffer the crisis. 
In conclusion, it should be said that all illegal actions should be punished and making copies of music and films and sharing them on the Internet, too. Because these particular actions may destroy the industry of making films and music and broadcasting them.

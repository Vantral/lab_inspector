Many people download music albums and compositions illegally from the Internet, which provoke many money loses by musicians. Should society punished this people or not? 
I believe that not, and my first arguement is that the downloading some data from the internet (like music compositions) is non-changing proscess of progress connected with Internet. It is unstoppable activity and ther are no mechanisms to stop uncontrolable downloading files from the internet. So, if we can't stop activity, we can't punish for this activity. Secondly, the musicans should reoriente their money interest in other ways in modern world from discs and compositions to concerts, advert and fan art. In other words, to some products, which is not sence to theft, which people want to buy to support their favourite musician or musical group. Thirdly, the alternative way to make effective and legal music albums sales in the Internet is register the music album in some music sites with payment subsciption like Itunes. It help musicians and their produsers get some persentage of money from this kind of web-sites. Finally, musicans can make some crowdfinging project to find some money to create a new albums. There are many crowdfinging web-sites in the Internet, which give a opportunity to find a huge amount money from many fans and intrested people, who are ready to pay for new albums before appearance of it. 
In conclusion, we can say, that the illegal downloading is unstoppable proscess, which can't be punished, so musicians must to find other ways to earn money and this ways are existed in modern world.

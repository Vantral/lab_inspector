The chart illustrates the value of the unemployment in some regions in the World due to the period from 2014 to 2015. In some of them the numbers did not change at all. For example, in the N. Africa in 2014 unemployment was 12.5% and in 2015 it is the same. Also, in the S. Asia the percentage of unemployment in 2014 and in 2015 did not raise and did not fall. Moreover, in some regions this value went down. For instance, there is a slight decrease of the value in the Middle East (from 11% to 8,6%). Also, the chart shows that in the EU there was a marginal increase of the unemployment rate (from 7,5% to 7,9%). The EU is the only one region from the chart where there is a rise of the unemployment. So, there are some flactuations in numbers in different world regions, but overall the value of unemployment did not change significantly over the span of two years.

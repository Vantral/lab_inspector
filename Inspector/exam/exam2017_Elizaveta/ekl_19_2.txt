Nowadays lots of films and music are upload in the Internet and can be downloaded for free. Some people think that sharing music and films is a criminal action and people share and use files in such illegal way should be punished. I totally disagree with this statement because this behaviour has pros, not only coins. 
Firstly, uploading music and films in the Internet for free usage makes a widespread advertisment for all participants of exact piece of art. This leads to increasing of the audiece and new fans. Particularly, musians, actors or film producers and directors do not have to spend lots of money on the advertisment in the modern world because sharing their works makes a great PR company. So that, if companies and musicians start to punish people that spread their pieces of art, they will lose lots of money and fans. 
Secondly, norms of music and films consumption have changed. It means that modern people prefer meet the content they want to buy before purchase it. Sharing music and films in the Internet gives such opportunity to potential purchasers. People nowadays buy music and films mostly to collect them or to help their favourite artists not because they want to have a lisence copy. So, taking off a possibility of testing material can lead to global results for musicians and film casts not to purchasing people that download files for free. 
In conclusion, downloading and uploading files that contains pieces of art can not be stopped and, what is more, should not be stopped because it makes lots of profits for their creators, especially with the help of people who do it.

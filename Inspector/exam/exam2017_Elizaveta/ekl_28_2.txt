There is an opinion that people who makes illegal pirate copies of music and films and shares it on the internet are stealing some kind of privat original information of producers and musicians and they have to be punished for that. In my opinion, that people have to. 
To start with, I would like to share idea that such kind of people steal money from the vorlets of film producers, and musicians, and singers who gave a lot of money and their own power and inspiration to make their products of art. So they have to pay money for film makers and other victims or go to jail or prison. Some European countries practis such kind of punishmens as I know. 
Second position is about decreasing value of culture: mass and elitist. If all people can watch any film they want or listen any music they decided to heart the products such as deep films, biographies of famous people, documental movies, instrumental music, opera songs and so on loss their value in society and in art. So people who download files with films and music have to be punished as human who injures the culture. 
Last but not least, the opposite opinion is that cultural products such as movies or music sould be free for all of people and it is partly right for me. But I prefer to know that this film or this producer watch people who knows other works of this man or woman and they take pleasure while watching or listening. So people who do not buy original discs should not copy the works and share it on the websites. 
To sum up, I want to say what decidion with punishing that people is absolutely right.

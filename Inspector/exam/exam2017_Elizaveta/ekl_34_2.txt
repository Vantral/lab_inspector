As of last, the Internet provides users with opportunities to share music and films without any restrictions. Some people believe that everyone should have an access to free products of art. However, others think that it is unfair for musicians and film makers web pirates should be responsible for their actions. There two points of view will be considered. 
On the one hand, there are a lot of people with low economical status who can not afford to buy music disks or attend cinemas. For example, some videos or music files can be posted on the sites where everyone can listen or watch them for free. Thus, pirates who spread movies and music can help people with different levels of access to finance increase their cultural capital. So, such a trend makes modern art more widespread and affordable for all social classes. 
On the other hand, some pirates try to diffuse music and films before they were reliesed to make some profit from it. For instance, they creat closed communities on social networks like Facebook and invite people there if they paied some fee. Such actions become buisiness which brings real income. So, this situation can be equal to robbery which is illegal all over the world. 
In a nutshell, social opinion on punishment for those people who spread films and music through the Internet can vary from the purpose of it. It they share such art object with people who do not have enough mony for free they should be punished in a not strict way or should not obtain any sanctions at all. However, if people make money from sharing they can be called pirates and must be pressed by the law. As for me, people who make watching movies and listening to music available only for private usage should not be punished in the same way as those who make their buisiness on someone's work.

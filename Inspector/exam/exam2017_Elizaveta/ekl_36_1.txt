The chart gives information on the unemployment rate in five world regions in 2014 and 2015 years. 
As can be seen from the chart the unemployment rate is quite different between regions. For example, in North Africa the percentage of unemployed people is the biggest while in South Asia it is more than twice smaller. 
There is an overall trend for unemployment rate in all regions. It remained stable or changed slightly from 2014 to 2015. For instance, in North Africa and South Asia the unemployment rate stayed at the same level in 2014 and 2015. In such regions as Middle East, EU and Latin America changes are not bigger than 3%, so they are not significant. 
In conclusion, in all regions the unemployment rate did not change a lot during two years. Nevertheless, there are significant differences in the persentage of unemployed people between these five regions.

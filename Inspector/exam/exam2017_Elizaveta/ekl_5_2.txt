Nowadays, with the development of the Internet and social networks there are a lot of ways to get the free access to goods that we normally should pay for. This situation is a real disaster for people who earn their own living selling these goods, for moovie or music makers, for example. Some might say that we should punish all the free content downloaders, others find that they are not guilty of anything. 
As for me, I don't find copying and sharing any content to be theft. This could be considered as theft thirty or even twenty years ago but not today, when internet is held in every household. And there are some reasons for it. 
Firstly, we do not steal the music or films because real creators of it do not get a lot of money for it. For example, a famous musician will earn much more from the concert or corporative than from selling his new album even if everybody will buy it legally. 
Secondly, I would like to mention that downloading music for free can be even better for our culture because it makes musicians or film producers to do their best and get as many fans as possible because it is not so important what quality of content you do, once you become famous people are not interested in your films or your music, they are interested in you particularly and this interest doesn't depend on content you make. 
To conclude I just want to say that we live in fast changing time. That means that copying and sharing music and films was a bad habit some years ago but today it is more likely to move the industry forward.

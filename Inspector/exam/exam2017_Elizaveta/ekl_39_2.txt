Today modern technologies provide opportunities to get mostly all content you need, specifically the Internet admitt to receive different types of information, including music records, films. Therefore, the problem of coping entertaining content on the Internet is a widely distributed phenomenon. Government ought to make punishment toughter in order to stop pirate copies. I agree with this statement and my arguments will be provided below. 
Firstly, all developed countries have a legislation to protect author's property. Thus, protection of author's should be more sustainable from government. For instance, some websites produce extra-content that requires money. Therefore, the owners of the websites prevent themself and others from commiting crimes. 
Secondly, coping and sharing music and videos are the business than ever before. People produce copies in order to get money. However, friendly users of the Internet can not download all files they need. Thus, government ought provide new punishment's sentenses to separate business and entertaiment. 
Thirdly, original things are more remakable for music and film fans. However, this option is more for previous generations. In the 21th century people do not use discs and other equipment, preffering memories of computers and other electronical devices. Despite this fact according to the norms and values, illigal pirate copies could not be in our ideal society. 
Last but not the least, my arguments analize the punishment and pirating on the Internet and to conclude this essay I would like to remember that all types of offendes are bad, all cause victims. I hope, that in further time governments of all cities will realize programms to protect people from crimes.

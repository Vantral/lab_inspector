In recent years the illegal pirate copies became more and more worldwide and a lot of musicians lost their money because of this issue. Some people tend to think that such illegal actions is bad and have to be punished, but I not support their point of view. 
There are 3 main reasons that can provide my opinion. Firstly, there are too many musicians sharing by free their musics with all people by Internet. This case shows that such free actions help them to become more popular and earn money by concerts. Secondly, not each person can afford to pay for music or video materials. Due to this, the free access to products can help them to self-educate and develop in creative ways. To illustrate that, we can remember that there are many educative movies with subtitles to improvement your language skills. If such films will be free, it may be caused of increasement knowledge among pupils or students which can not pay for it. Accordingly to music, we can also state that free musical materials can help in studying language, for instance, teenagers may know some new words or phrases and how it is correct spealing. Finally, there are many various ways to earn money by musicians or producers, not including saling the copyright on products. For example, they also sale some clothes or other merchandizing products with musical groups or singers' images on it which can help to take a lot of money from buying these items. 
To sum up, not all pirate copies bring such big material damages to producers and people who share these files by free should not be punished because of their good desires in order to bring the possibility free watching or listening video or music materials to other people around the world.

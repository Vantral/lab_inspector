Nowadays people live in the era of techical progress and everyday development of different spheres of their lifes. Therefore, the culture industry as one of these spheres has also changed a lot, and one of this changes is the opportunity to buy and download music, films on the Internet, which leaded to the proliferation of illegal downloading. However, I absolutely disagree with the claim that people should be punished for illegal copying and in what follows, this point of view is going to be examined. 
First, there is great number of legal cites that allow people to downolad interesting for them music, films and other files legally. Furthermore, as different studies and serveys show, people are more likely to use legal ways for downloading files, even if they know the illegal ones. Therefore, I believe that punishment is too strict for those who upload or download illegal files, because people mostly face strong moral norms in society which don't allow them to use illegal copying. 
Second, I personally do not think that the fact that musicians or producers lose huge amounts of money from pirate copies can be named as a reason for punishment of those who do it. People visit concerts, theatres, they buy legally all the files both in real and internet shops. All of this brings a huge amount of money for musicians, artists and producers. Therefore, I think that they can allow people to download some files for free instead of blaiming or punishing them for pirate copies. Moreover, all people pay taxes and for that reason they can allow themselves to download some files for fee. 
In conclusion, it is clear to me that pirate copying and those who use it should not be punished and these resources should just be legalized.

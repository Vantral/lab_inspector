Owing to the fact the Internet nowadays is the most up-to-date and high spreading technology, computer users get the possibility to copy and download media files without any bondaries and banners. Therefore the work of musicians and film producers stay without any payment. Some people argue that this situation should be shanged by the way of banner illegal coping. In my opinion, it is not a good idea and I desagree that the cultural music and film production should be in acsess only for money. 
Cultural and film makers' goods need to have their audience to be used. Majority of this audience is suffering the Internet in search of good content. Internet copies keep in safety two important things for people: time and money. First of all, making the money boundaries leads to loss of people, who are interested in new music and films but cound not spend their time on going to the cinema, for example. Secondly, today people have a lot of works to be done and a little payment for that. So usage of internet becomes the helpfull tool in everyday working and pleasure. If a person has not money to buy a ticket or music disc, she or he can dowload il from the Internet as the Internet is associated with something provides various types of information rapidly and mostly without payment. 
Moreover, the real creators of art should do it for enjouyment and pleasure for themselves. The Intenet gives them in addition more popularity. It is not unattractive. They should stop to ask from people more money for their creativity, as they could play concerts and translated films on festivals and in cinema and give money from this kind of entertnemneit. 
To sum up, it is clear to me that coping from Internet should be legalized on particular level.

The graph illustrates the dynamics of the unemployment rate in 2014 and 2015 by world region. 
Overall, it is evident from the graph that although the percent of unemployed people has not changed, such regions as European Union, Middle East and Southern Asia saw either a decrease or an increase in the unemployment rate. In contrast, the rate stayed stable in other regions. 
As for the countries where the percentage of unemployed population didn't change, it is clear that EU is the only region that witnessed an increase, with 7,9 percent of population being unemployed in 2015. Middle East countries, in turn, saw the largest decrease in the rate of unemployment, with 1,4 percent of the unemployed population getting a job in 2015. 
When it comes to the countries where the amount of people without a job stayed the same, it can be seen that Northern African countries suffer more from unemployed comparing to Southern Asia states, with the rate being 12,5 percent in the former case and 3,9 percent in the latter one.

Nowadays World wide web plays a significant role in humans life. People can find any kind of information not giving any payment for it. But a lot of singers and film-makers lose their money, because of the non-licensed copies, which are spread all over the Internet. Should we somehow punish the people, who make and use illegal materials? To my mind, such people should be punished. 
First of all, work in creative spheares such as music and film-making is time and power demanding. Except this resources producers have to invest some of their money to create a new product. To my mind, it's not honest, that people do not appreciate the work of that people and use illegal materials from the Internet. In my opinion, World Wide web has to be more controlled. But now, a lot of web pages with film or music materials are getting closed because of new law in the Constitution, the main idea of which is that the rights of author shouldn't be taken away from he. 
Secondly, now almost everyone can afford himself to buy a song in some app or go to the cinema, because the prices for these materials are low. But lots of people do not understand that we have to pay for art materials the same as we pay for food products in the supermarket. As the result people download materials with the low quality for free, instead of paying small amount of money for the legal and high-quality material. So, people like that do not fully enjoy the product and steal money from the producers. 
In conclusion I want to say, that government have to accept strict law agains the Internet pirates, so the labour of singers and producers will be appreciated and people will change their attitude to the art.

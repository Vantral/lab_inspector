Nowadays a large number of people download from the Internet illegal pirate copies of songs and films going against the law of copyright. This process is unstoppable because people do not want to pay for the original versions. So, the authors as well as musicians and film makers consiquently lose huge amount of money. I believe that people who theiving from the official authors should pay great bills as producers of films and music songs can not gain money for their work and they are more likely to be copied illegally and lose their uniqueness. 
First, when a song or a film is downloaded illegally before it is launched officially, producers and creators of these products of culture lose big money since people will unlikely go the cinema to watch the premier. Instead of this they, for example, download this song or film from the Internet and watch it at home at any time they would like to watch even if the quality is not excellent. In this case people can choose what they will pay for and what they will not pay to watch on a big screen in the cinema. 
Furthermore, singers who produce a lot of songs every year are also in the danger of not making profit because pirate copies are very easily replace them and, unfortunately, many not very famous singers are being copied and their fame go to the people who make theft. Undoubtedly, it is highly guilty when your product is being used and named by another person. 
In conclusion, our century is the century of progress and innovation and, unfortunately, with creation of the Internet lose their face and start stealing by downloading the illegal copies of the original products of culture. In my view, such kind of people should be punished by paying the bill.

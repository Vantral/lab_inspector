Nowadays with constantly improving technologies there exist big problem via the Internet and market connecting illegal pirate copies of music and films. Many people argue that copying and sharing these files should be punished. I totaly disagree with this opinion because in global culture it is impossible to prevent all cases of sharing copies and actually it is not necessary. 
On the one hand, there are author's rights that don't allow to make copies of art pieces. It is illegal to steal original file and make copies of them. What is more, loads of money are lost every year by musicians and film producers because of thefts. That is why many people think that it is necessary to punish those ones who download pirate files instead of buying the original discs. 
On the other hand, many people in the world can't buy the original music disk or film. If they didn't watch films and listen to music, they would not socialize and learn the art and the culture of their country or the world as whole. It seems important to teach children from early childhood the cultural traditions which are translated via the pieces of art. Furthermore, every day people download a lot of files from the Internet and it is impossible to punish all of them. Finally, popularity of many films and song is achieved by their copies. People download them because they are free. 
To sum up, although misicians and film producers lose significant percentage of their money because of illegal pirate copies, many people can have access to music and films which help them to socialise and spend a good time.

It is well-known that illegal usage of music or films is popular it todays world. We live in postmodern world where technology plays the biggest part in ours lives. Thanks to technology we can find any information we like including music and films. It is important to emphisize that all the information we get for free. Thus, some says that copying and sharing music or films on the Internet for free is illegal and people should be punished for that actions but other people claim that it has already become a part of ours life and Internet will never solve the problem of pirating. 
First of all, if we say that people who download files on the Internet, instead of bying the original discs, should be punished, it means that almost all users on the Internet should be in jail or should pay some fee. Unfortunately, it is uneasy to do. There is no method of finding the person who download that illega pirate copy and I am sure that it will not appear soon, because of the great amount of people who do this. 
Moreover, there are a big amount of examples which illustrate us that companies adopted to the pirating on the Internet and this strutures make a lot of profit from that. For instance, there are some websites where you buy films, TV series or music but paying money to that website you get not only one special film but a lot of benefits like uncutted sceine. There is a website where people can buy TV series which have a subtitles on russian or english.

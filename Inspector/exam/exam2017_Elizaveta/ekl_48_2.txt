Nowadays filmmakers and musicians lose a plenty of money annually due to illegal pirate copies. There are a lot of thefts who copy and then share songs and films in the Internet. Some people believe that these illegals shoud be punished. As for me, I can't agree with this opinion at all. 
To my mind, not all people can go to the cinema or to the concert to listen to perfect songs and to watch interesting movies. We mostly live in democratic countries, that's why we should avoid the discrimination or segregation. I'm sure that all people should have the access to cultural capital. If some people can't go to the cinema or concerts, they can watch films or listen to music via the Internet. Pirate copies play an important role in this case. Another benefit of pirate copies is that people who are not able to go out due to their diseases can use pirate copies and consume cultural products. 
Hoewer, some peope have another point of view. They argue that people who make illegal copies are real thefts and they must be punished. It seems for them that making illegal copies of originals is untrue to the authors. Making a film or a song, authors spend a great amount of their time, strength and money as well. They are tallents of their products. Hence it is awful to use their work to make money by coping and sharing songs and film. 
To sum up, there are some advantages and disadvantages of pirate copies in the Internet. Some people are for punishments for thefts while some people use these pirate copies. Personally, I think that pirate copies make sense but "thefts" should pay some money to authors for coping and sharing.

The amount of cultural products on the market, namely music and films, is steadily growing which makes it crucial to control the means of their distribution. Personally, I agree with the statement that pirate copies consumption should be legally prosecuted. In the following paragraphs, two arguments supporting my position will be presented. 
To begin with, the production of any kind of goods, including cultural ones, costs money for the producers themselves. For example, in order to listen to a song, the lyrics as well as the melody should be written first and then the sound needs to be recorded and edited so that the quality of it is high. Obviously, such steps have to be financially supported. Film production can also be taken as an instance. For making a proper movie, it takes for the producers to hire a cast, find a script writer, buy all the equipment needed, and make costumes for the actors, which requires a certain amount of money as well. Thus, producers have to charge money for films and songs in order to make them. 
Secondly, all the people involved in a film or song production spend their own time and effort on contributing to the creation of something unique. Products of art differ from ordinary consumer goods because they can not be produced massively. This fact should be taken into consideration while consuming pirate copies because money are aimed to represent people's gratitude for the work that has been done and not only to pay the bills of producers. Therefore, those who do not consume films and songs legally show disrespect to those who have made these products. 
Summing up, the consumption of pirate copies of cultural goods needs to be taken under control because of the financial losses and the amount of disrespect that producers suffer from. In the future, if the trend of pirate copying continues to grow, there will be less cultural goods produced by independent film-makers or songwriters.

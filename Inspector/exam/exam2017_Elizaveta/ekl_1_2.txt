Our century is characterized by up-to-date technologies, using which we can create differents kinds of art, such as music and films. Many people find these materials on the Internet and download them by illegal ways. Some people believe that this action is not normal, and it should be punished. I partly agree with this statement, and I prove the point below. 
To begin with, musicians or producers who create some songs, performances or films have their own rights. They work hard in order to reach such success. However, there are some people, who break the law and take these original versions. Consequently, they distribute the information on the Internet and different social networks, where everyone has an access to get it. It is not right, because these people do harm to the creators. Secondly, this practice should be removed, because the original version has a price and a value, but anyone does not buy a product, he/she copies a file on their computer and enjoy. All citizens must have equal rights and do everything using legal methods. 
On the other hand, there are some advantages from pirate versions. Not buying the original, you can try to feel something the same. For example, if you can not to get an original game, you can download a pirate copy and play computer game without any problems. 
To sum up, copying and sharing some kinds of art on the Internet causes a lot of problems in the society, and this problem must be solved.

The graph gives the information about people who don't have work in the different world regions throughout the period of 2014 and 2015 year. The main trend is that worldwide proportion of unemployment is the same in 2014 and 2015 (is equal 5,9 percent) and represent the middle rate of unemployment in the world. 
As it is shown on the chart, the greatest amount of unemployment people are in Northern Africa. The proportion of such kind of people is 12,5 percent. Such numbers stay stable in 2014 and do not change in 2015 year. That stable tendency is also common for another regions, but the percentage of people without work is much lower than in N. Africa. 
As we could see in the chart, the smallest unemployment rate is in S. Asia (3,9 percent), in comparison to all regions. The number 3,9 percent doesn't fluctuate through the period of one year and stay stable in 2014 and 2015. Such numbers are also smaller than worldwide percentage of unemployment rate, but that data is also the part of a worldwide proportion.

In our time, technologies have developed to the level of a worldwide access to many resourses which are make possible watching movies and listening to music without any payment. Many people copy and share production on the Internet. All these actions cause artist's income lose. 
It is clear that the less we pay, the less artists get. However, I do not agree with the point of view that people copying and sharing "art products" should be punished. There are three reasons. 
First, many people can not afford themselves buying music albums or going to the cinema as often as they want to watch a movie, but they still need to watch films and to listen to music, they can do in throug the Internet. 
Second, there are many artists who get a lot of money for their concerts, shows and views of their video-clips on Youtube. Many of them have millions and this lose of income can not hurt them. 
Finally, sometimes people do not know the contention of a film or a music album, and if they will be sad if do not like the product. Instead of "future sadness", they can choose a free watching or listening. 
To sum up, people who copy and share movies and music on the Internet sould not be punished, because they make students and other poor people happy and not feeling upset, becouse of paying for the products which is not, finally, suit them.

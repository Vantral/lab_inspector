The diagram presents information about the quantity of unemployment people in 5 different regions in 2014 and 2015 to compare. 
Overall, it can be seen from the graph that maximum and minimum variables remained stable during two years. There is some movement in the middle, however. 
For example, the number of unemployed in the Middle East has decreased since 2014 from 11 per cents to 9,6. The similar situation takes place in South Asia, where the fall of unemployment rate was one per cent. 
Furtemore, we can see a growth of unemployment in Europe. In the 2014 there were 7,5 per cents, in 2015, after the number increased, it was 7,9 per cents. 
The last variable called "Worldwide" says that from 2014 to 2015 there were no changes if we look on the whole world without deviding it on regions.

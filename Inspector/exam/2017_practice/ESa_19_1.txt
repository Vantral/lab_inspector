I am going to tell you a few words about the features of transportation goods by rail and by road. To begin with, these two diagramms show us the statistics of transportation of goods between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008. In the first diagram I can see that the metals are the most popular good transported by rail, whereas in the second diagramm I can see that food products transported by road more often than other types of goods. The least percentage in the first diagramm has the goods such as chemicals, whereas in the second diagramm we can see that the goods such as machinery stayes on this position. Manufactured goods not fully have the same percentage on both diagrammes. This example is the same for goods such as chemicals. The most different comparison is the percentage of metals on both diagrams.

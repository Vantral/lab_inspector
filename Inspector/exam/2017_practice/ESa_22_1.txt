The pie graphs shows such goods as metals, chemicals, machinery and others that were transported by rail and road in 2008. 
That is to say, more than one third of goods transported by rail were metals. And for the road transport, food products were transported mostly. However, in both diagramms equal parts are occupied by manufactured goods. Mainly, machinery occupies only 2% of all the diagramm of goods transported by road, but in another pie graph it is in 6 times bigger - about 12%. Also, from goods transported by rail non-metallic minerals have the littelest part from the chart, but from the road transport they are on the on the second place from the end with equal persantage (11 and 13%). 
To sum it up, transportation of goods in Eastern Europe in 2008 by road and rail really vary. But some parts (Non-metallic minerals and manufactured goods) are equal.

Two pie charts illustrate percentage of goods transported by rail-mounted transport and road vehicles in Eastern Europe in 2008. 
Generally, this statistics says that some types of goods are mostly transported by trains and some by LGUs, HGUs, motor lorries etc. The chart also allows to compare amount of goods delivered by motorized vehicles or by rail transport in each category. 
The most remarkable parts of the chart show amount of metals transportation and food products by railroads and roads. Almost a third of transport traffic for each category is responsible for these sorts of freight. In addition The second biggest sectors of diagrams show percentage of manufactured goods delievered, and it is almost equal for each kind of transportation. 
Part of machinery, chemical and food products is almost equal for rail-mounted vehicles. Motorized transport delievered metals, chemicals and non-metallic minerals in nearly identical quantity. 
Overall, manufactured goods require less specific transportation conditions as we can conclude from comparable percentage indicators. Obviously, the general quantity of goods transported by rail of by road has to be considered, although their part in charts differs only for 3 per cent.

The charts given illustrate the structure of goods transported in Eastern Europe in 2008. The information in the first pie chart refers to rail transportation while the second chart deals with road transportation. 
All in all, it can be seen from the graphs that about a quater of all freight transported by each mean of transport is referred to manufactured goods. If talking about rail transportation, the biggest percentage (35%) of goods are metals. Considering road transportation, food products are the most common type of freight (30%). The smallest part of goods, which is only 6% of overall quantity, is classified as "non-metallic minerals" if speak about transportation by rail. At the same time, the situation with road transportation is as follows. The type of goods being transported in smaller quantities than others is machinery (2%). 
Consequently, it is possible to detect main features of transportation of goods in Eastern Europe in 2008. Apparently, manufactured goods are likely to be transported in large quantities by both rail and road. However, railroad transport is more suitable for transporting metals, which are heavy and bulky, while road transportation is convenient for moving food products from point of production to point of consumption in shorter period of time.

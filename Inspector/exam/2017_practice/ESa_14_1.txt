The chart illustrates the structure of shipment of goods in Eastern Europe in 2008. It includes two diagramms which describe freight transported by road as well as by rail. 
The main cargo transported by rail is metals, which is more than a third of all goods being shipped. On the other hand, food products have the biggest percentage in the road shipment. In addition, manufactured goods have almost the same shares for both rail and road shipments. 
Food products delivery by rail is not as popular in comparison with road transport, but nevertheless, machinery transportation contains 12 percent of general freight transported by rail, while there is only 2 percents shipped by road. According to the chart, road transport carries about 16 percent of chemicals, but at the same time, there is 11 percent of it carried by rail transport. 
In conclusion, one thing should be pointed out. Perishable freight tend to be transported by road more than rail. Nevertheless, rail transport is able to carry more heavy goods, such as metals, non-metallic minerals and other goods.

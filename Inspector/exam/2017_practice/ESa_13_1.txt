Two charts demonstrate the transportation of goods by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. 
The amount of non-metallic minerals transported by road is twice bigger than by rail. While the number of metals transported by rail is three times higher than by road. Food products are tend to be transported mostly by road. The amount of manufactured goods transported by road is practically the same as by rail. 
From the first chart it is obvious that it is prefered to transport metals by rail (35 per cent). Food products is the most popular good for road transportation (30 per cent). The same amount of chemicals and food products are transported by rail (11 per cent). Less popular good for railway transportation is non-metalic minerals (only 6 per cent). While the smallest amount of goods transported by road is machinery. 
Overall, there is a tendency to drive to transport metals mostly by rail, while for food products the most apropriate way is road transportation.

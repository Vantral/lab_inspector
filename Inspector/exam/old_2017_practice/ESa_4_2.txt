To begin with, we live in the world in which modern technology play important role today. Some people think that increasing numbers number of health problems depends on active using of modern devise. I do not think so and believe that modern technology has adventages more than disadventages.

First of all, modern devices improve our life and lifestyle. There is no doubt that modern computors help us to fait with new dengerouse weatnesses. More over, smartphones can help modern pupils to study new subjects faster and also they can give any information, which we are interested. Finally, modern technology like wave, it cn help help modern women vaste of less time to cook dinner, for example.

On the other hand, it cannot be denied that modern technology has some disadventures. Modern computers influent negativly children's eyes and all healthy. In addition, some times we cannot control modern technology. For example it is very popular nowadays to have technics, like robot, that can clean your house and wash your dishes. Nonetheless there are a lot of situation, when such things became uncontrol and even it is known there are bad ends. 

I think that we must think better when we create new modern technology. Government should give enough money in oder to scientist can check better their inovations. Authority can create new programs and organization, where we can moderate new devices. 

All in all, I can conclude that this question is very hard to answerd it now. Modern technology has pluses and minuses. It goes without saying time will tell whose part of men is right and what modern devices can change our world.

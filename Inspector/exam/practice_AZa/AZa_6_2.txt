Nowadays there exist two different views on the phenomenon of the import. Some people believe that we must reduce it as much as possible and produce goods only for countrie’s population while others hold the opposite point of view. Why do they think so? Let us speculate over it.
On the one hand, I think, import have an important role to play in the life of all countries. We can’t refuse its influence on the economy of every state. Import, in particular, can make better the economical conditions more developed. More than that it will bring profit not for the government only but for population too. Besides, not all kinds of food can be made in one country only. For example, north regions can’t grow fruits and vegetables, that is why they have to get it from south partners.
On the other hand, sometimes import reach the level which bring negative consequences to the particular country and they are are also connected with the economy. For instance, some kind of products are too expensive to by them in foreing countries. Therefore, such things would not be bought by ordinary person. This situation will tell on the political conditions of the state.
To sum up, we can see that both views are possible/ However, I personally agree with the firt one and believe that the importance of import should not be underestimated because it is still the crucial aspect for most countries in the world.

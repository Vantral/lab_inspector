There are a lot of problems connected with food in our world. In some countries a lot of people die because there is not enough food for everybody. In some areas it is impossible to grow up seeds or fruits and vegetables. So should countries who are able to produce the food only for their population and import as little as possible?
In my opinion, each of these countries should produce as many as possible, so they will be able to export their own food to poor countries, to help people to survive of hunger. Futhermore, there are a lot of people for whom tasting different food is a hobby. Most of them will be at least disapointed if their favourite type of exotic fruit disappear from shops. Not every british enjoy british food.
There is also another opinion. Some people suppose that countries only need to produce the food for their own population. In this case every country saves its historical and cultural food traditions. Moreover decreasing the amount of products which are imported should stabilase economic problems of the country by selling its own food. 
These people don’t realise that pasta in Australia would never be like pasta in Italia. Simply because australian people don’t have such technologies and historical advices as Italian people have by growing these seeds for countries. At least that’s why countries should produce the food more and share it with other countries. Our modern society is built on the principe of different abilities and chances. So everybody should be able to buy italian cheese in the nearest shop even if he lives in Australia. Importing products is one of the most important factors of country communication, and aim of every country should be balancing it with producing their own products.

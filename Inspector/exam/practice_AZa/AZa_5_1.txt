The provided diagrams give data on changings in temperatures (an average information). Both graphs cover the period from January to December. Generally, the most striking feature here is the fact that there is no cold temperature in Brazil, in comparison with that in Russia.
It is clearly seen that the first diagram is about gradual ups and downs. Firstly, all maximum and minimum indexes begin in January at nearly - 35 and - 41 degrees respectively. After that there is an upward trend and all lines reach a peak point in July, and then there is a drop which goes down. The ending point is almost the same as the beginning one.
In contrast with the first graph, the second one can be characterized as a steady one with some fluctuations. It is remarkable that both lines are close to each other and they have a mild decline from April to July.
Overall, both charts have their own characteristics, and they are not similar.

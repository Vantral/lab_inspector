These line graphs depict the average values of temperature in two cities: in Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. Horizontal axes show the period during which these values are exposed to changing. Vertical axes demonstrate the index of temperature.
Generally speaking, we notice that the coldest month is January and December in Russia as a comparison to Brazil, where January is the hottest month. Considering the change of temperature in Russia, we observe fairly significant but at the same time steady increase of climat’s values and then their decline step-by-step. It can be emphasized that the index reach a peak of approximately 25 °C in July in Russia.
As we can observe from the second line chart, the temperature in Rio de Janeiro remains steady almost during all period considered. It starts from 30 °C in January then it is exposed to slight decreasing. As the line chart reveals, the minimum index of temperature in Brazil is 20 °C in July. After July the values of maximum temperature fluctuate and then returns to the index which have been at the beginning.
In conclusion, due to these graphs we can consider remarkable differences of climate in Russia and Brazil. In spite of the fact that winter in Russia is the coldest season, it is the hottest one in Brazil.

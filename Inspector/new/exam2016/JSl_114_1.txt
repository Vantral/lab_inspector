The following bar chart illustrates how investment in renewable energy in developed and developing countries changes in the period of seven years (from 2006 to 2013 respectively) and the line graph above the bar chart represents changes of a world total investment of the same period of time.

It reached the pick in 2011, when more than 250 amount of money was invested in renewable energy.

Overall, what stands out from the graphs, that till the year 2011 investment in both developed and developing countries had an upward trend and, but after hitting the top mark that year, it went down sharply.

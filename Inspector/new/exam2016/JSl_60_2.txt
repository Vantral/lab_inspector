For example, when an international company moves a business to a developing country, it needs workers and for that reason provides free education for local people.

In other words, sooner or later the new factories will need qualified local workers to be managed by, so the chiefs often build new schools in the area or provide free higher education for local youngsters.

Summing up, we can see that there are more advantages of the process of moving business to developing countries, but I am in favour of the idea that the harm caused by disadvantages is so serious that event the improvements cannot cover it.

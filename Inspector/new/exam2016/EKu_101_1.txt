This scheme which is given in the task, illustrates changing in worldwide investment in renewable energy from 2006 to 2013 in countries which were developing, which have already developed at that period of time, and as a worls total.

The first line which demonstrates world's total, shows that investment in renewable energy constantly increased from 2006 to 2011 when it had finished its grow, and had started to decreased.

It is interesting that both developed countries and developing ones had the same direction in their investment as a world total.

However, the developing countries' level of worldvide investment in renewable energy seems to be more low than the same level of developed countries.

Moreover, the amount of energy's investment of developing countries was always low, its highest pick was around 100 Bn in 2012, while developed countries and, of course, world total have a higher level in their investment.

Thus, developed and developing countries and world total have almost the same direction in their investment in renewable energy.

At the very beginning and till 2011 2012 the investment increased and then, it started to decreased.

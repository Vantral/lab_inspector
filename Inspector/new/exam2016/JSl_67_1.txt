From the graph it can be seen that the investment in renewable energy at both developed and developing countries remained the same trend with 2009 being an example when the amount of investment in developed countries declined from 110 billions of dollars to 100 ones but in developing countries this number showed a slight increase.

A world total shows its increases and decreases in the same manor that developed countries.

All in all it can be seen that worldwide investment related to developed countries more than developing ones because the amount of investment in developed countries was much higher.

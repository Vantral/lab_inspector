On the one hand, people think that if they make prison sentence longer many future crimes will be reduced because burglar, murder, kidnapper and others will think twice before make a crime.

On the other hand, other people advise better, alternative ways of reducing a crime such as special moral subjects in school, increasing government payments for homelesses and so on.

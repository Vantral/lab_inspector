It goes without saying, travelling by airplanes influense our ecosystem.

There is an opinion, that government have to create special laws to regulate the level of travelling by air, to prove this argument people say, that air travel is unnecessary in most cases.

To sum up, I would like to say that inspite travelling by planes, or some other airmachines as well as all modern technologies destroy our planet's ecosystem by spoiling atmosphere, air pollution or global warming, governments must not use extreme measures to cope with this situation.

There have to be some special tools in airmachines or on the surface of our planet to protect the world we live in.

Nowadays there is a really interesting trend among international companies.

There are two major opinions concerning the issue.

On one hand, it does have a lot of advantages since the cost of labour in those poorer, developing countries is significantly lower but on the other hand while doing that companies might see that there are a lot more disadvantages than advantages of this development.

Now I suppose we should look further into the issue.

I personally believe that this new trend of moving companies to poorer regions makes a lot of sense.

First of all, as i've mentioned before it might help the companies to reduce the amount of money they spend on paying their workers the salary which means they will consequently end up having a bigger revenue.

Moreover, the taxes in those countries are usually lower which again means the company will make more money.

Not suprisingly there is of course another opinion.

Some people believe that the whole process of moving the company to another region might cost a lot more money than the company could possibly get from reducing the cost of labour.

But I disagree since I believe that if a comapny has a good plan everything is going to be ok.

To sum up, I believe that before making any decision the company should set up a plan so a company

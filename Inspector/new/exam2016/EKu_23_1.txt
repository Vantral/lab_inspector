Bar charts demonstrate the modification in the spendings on the renewable energy made both by developed and developing countries in the period from 2006 to 2013.

It can be deduced from the graph that expenditure on renewable energy made by developed countries grows steadily during the whole period of time reaching its maximum in 2011 accounts for 180 billion of dollars.

However, after reaching its all-time high the investment begins to decline to 120 billion of dollars in 2013.

The figures of investment made by developing countries rises sharply from less then 50 billions in 2006 to aproximately 110 billions in 2012 demonstrating four-time increase.

All in all, developed countries invest more money in renewable energy than developing countries, even thouhg their investment increase stedily.

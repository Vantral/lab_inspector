The first advantage is very important for any company : developing its business and bringing it to other countries means more customers and more money.

Of course, it does not mean that on the next day after opening all locals will run to this office and buy everything.

Secondly, it is rather obvious, that the level of salaries in poor countries is low : people from poor countries will not ask a high salary.

If the company will employ many people, it will save it a lot of money.

On the other hand this development can have many difficulties, some of which can hardly be solved.

If the cultural background of two countries is too different, the company will have to adapt its business for the local's rules and traditions.

A good worker should share the interests of the company : if he does not, he will not work for success.

But sometimes the company may have no choice, employ everyone and later have to solve new problems which were caused by this workers.

To sum up, there are many pro and contra in developing business to poorer countries.

The chart also illustrates the gender and region divisions, the proportion of boys and girls and presenting the data in 3 main regions (Africa, South Asia and rest of the world), respectively.

It can be clearly seen that in all the 3 regions the number of children with no access to primary education tends to lower.

This thesis can be better illustrated by the data from South Asia, where the number of boys to whom primary education was not available decreased in 2 times (from 11\.

It is also obvious that in 2000 the number of boys with no access to primary education was always lower than the number of girls presented.

Nevertheless, the dramatic changes by 2012 showed that in all the countries, except Africa, the difference between the boys and girls numbers was overcome and the numbers turned to be almost equal.

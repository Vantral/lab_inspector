Nowadays our society faces to face with many ecological problems such as air pollution, water pollution, increasing the number of deseases, which can lad to global disaster.

I think, that there are a lot of other reasons for air pollution and global warming, air travelling is only one puzzle of all picture.

And we should seach the other way to cope with its problem, but introduction laws to reduce the amount of using airbuses is not suitable for modern society.

First of all, airbuses are the most convenient, cheapest and fasten kind of transport.

And if governments introduce laws that reduce the number of air travel for business and leisure, it could cause social disaster, "bum" among people.

Moreover, there are a lot manufactories, factories that provide all kinds of pollution more than other things.

And scientists did many researches in this area and said that airzoles which are using in our everyday life all over the world contribute a great to air pollution (about 15% according to the results of researches).

To sum up, I want to say that, of course, using airbuses a lot of time has its drawbacks and has a negative influence.

But we should not forget about the main factors of air pollution and global waming at all; toxic wastes of factories, using some things in our everyday life.

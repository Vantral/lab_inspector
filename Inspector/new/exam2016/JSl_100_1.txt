Turning to deteils, it can be clearly seen that the investment in renewable energy was much more in developed countries (much more about half).

The investment in developed countries had increased since 2006, nevertheless, since 2011 it had gone down from about 170 billion $ to nearly 130 billion $.

As for developing countries, there is clearly seen that the peak of investment in this field was in 2012 (just above 100 billion $).

The most striking feature is that in world total the investment in renewable energy remain unchanged in 2008 2009, but after that it went up dramatically from above 150 billion $ to approximately 280 billion $.

Overall, what stands out from the data is that by 2011 there had been a trend to increase investment in renewable energy, but after that one was observed stable decline.

In developing countries there are a lot of people, which lost job and want to find new work.

Secondly, in this countries can be cheaper material, but also good as in developed countries.

It is convinient to developed countries to create some new things from cheaper material and save money for something else, for example for advertising.

In contrast, nobody knows, is the material, which produce developing countries is really good and healthy.

There are a lot of games for children on the market, which made of bad material and can destroy child's health.

Moreover, international companies do not know the quantity of offises, where material is producing and do not know people, who work there.

Local people are not responsible for material and for process of creation new things.

So it is a risk for international market.
<So AV0><it PNP><is VBZ><a AT0><risk NN1><for PRP><international AJ0><market NN1><. SENT>@
In the conclusion, it can be said, that there are a lot of disadvantages in opening and continuing buisiness in poorer countries, because developing countries do not realize rules and standarts of companies of developed countries.

But it will be good to begin this buisiness with developing countries and involve them at the beginning in the idea of building successfull company.

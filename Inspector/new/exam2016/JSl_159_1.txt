Firstly, we can see that in developed contries investment in renewable energy has gradually increased until 2006 at just above $ 100 bn and then slightly went down the following year.

Although in developed countried the amount of investment fluctuated, in developing contries investment had a positive trend and it rose from approximately $ 25 bn to just above $ 100 bn through the period from 2006 to 2013, and then it slightly declined in 2013.

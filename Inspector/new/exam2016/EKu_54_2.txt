Firstly, it is widely believed that some prisoners can run away from the law and the prison as well and they believe that prolonging sentences for them can prevent others to make crime.

On the other hand, many of killers and burglars are said to be normal people before having made crime and some people state that the problem is in people`s psychology.

They assume that there are other ways to avoid deviation, for example, stop watching cruel films, playing some kind of games, start doing some sports, etc.

To my mind, the government of each country should pay a lot of attention on this question and encourage people to be cultivee, well - educated and responsible.

I agree with those people who say that we shoud avoid watching TV videos with doubdful content, because crime is a consequence of our habits.

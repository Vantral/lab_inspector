However, daring the flight on this transport are emmited a lot of gases such as dioxyde (CO2), carboxyde and others, so it leads to air pollution.

To conclude, I would like to say that law's requirements are necessary in the sphere of air travelling because nowadays the enviromental problems are very actual.

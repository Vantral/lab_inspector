As the technologies are being developed every year, humanity has started to think about our planet.

There is a point of view that because of harmfull effects of air travel like air pollution and global warming governments have to decrease air travelling for business and leisure I partly agree with this statement.

There is no doubt that humanity must take care of our home, our planet human actions cased so many environmental problems, so reducing even only one of them will be beneficial for Earth.

Nevertheless, making laws against air travelling is not the only way to reduce pollution.

Humanity can not live without planes therefore we must make it more ecological.

To sum up, I strongly believe that reducing air travelling will not sole the problem with pollution and global warming, it will only make people think that they are taking care of environment, to my mind possible solution is making new fuel for planes, which will not poison air.

The general idea is that, nowadays the level of such children decreased rapidly in all three regions.

But still, South Asia takes the first place, because there are only 10 millions children, who cant go to primary school.

In 2000 the number of such children was almost 33 millions.

However, this number sound quite enormous, today, in Africa this number is the same.

But still, I can't say that there was no progress in Africa : in 2000, the amount of children without access to primary education was incredible : almost 45 millions!

Inspite in the rest of the world in 2000 the number was lowest - only 23\.

Generally, there are more girls, who cant enter primary school, but South Asia in 2012 is an exeption : there are more boys now.

To sum up, I'd like to say, that the number of kids, who has no possability to have primary education decreased sharply.

The best results in solving this problem are in South Asia.

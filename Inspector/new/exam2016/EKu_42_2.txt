However, these simingly noble and progressive actions with obvious advantages encounter an opinion that in reality they only harm by preventing poor countries from developing their own potencials.

To sum up, moving big international businesses to poorer countries have some certain advantages, however it can be good only for solving the problems that lie on the surface like unemployment and lack of money.

In a deeper perspective this economic strategy can be even harmful, for it leads to the total dependence of developing countries on the developed ones and prevent them from making their domestic economics stronger.

First of all, when international companies hired locals they not only give many workplaces for people but also help those countries to inrich their economy.

Another positive aspect of such cases is that usually when companies build their factories they improve roads and lands, which are located not far from the territory of their factories.

Speaking about th other side of the coin, developing businesses in poorer countries definitely has some negative aspects.

One of the main disadvantages is that with increase of factories the nature of such countries as India and China is getting poorer and wicker.

In conclusion, personally I believe that there are more good aspects of moving companies' businesses to developing countries such as India and China, but never should we forget about eco resources that could take years to be renewed.

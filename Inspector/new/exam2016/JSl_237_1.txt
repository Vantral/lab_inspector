Considerably the numbers closer, it should be said that the most significant dynamic was shown by South Asia with an impressive decline in the number of non-educated girls (from 21,6 mln in 2000 to 4,8 mln in 2012) that was supported by a solid decrease in the amount boys (from 11,1 mln to 5,1).

Other regions performed not as strong as South Asia but also showed some progress : Africa had an around 20% decreased of boys without primary education and a 5,5 million decrease of girls with the same characteristics.

As for me, I think that global warming is one of the most important problems for humanity in the 21st century.

So, as the airplanes have significant impact on this factor, governments should decline this risks by creating new laws for air companies and people who travel a lot.

What is more, everyone knows that airports are never situated in the cities, but near them.

One of the main reasons of this is that negative effect of airplanes is still one of the common dangers mentioned by specialists.

Providing air pollution, air travelling should be more reasonable, I think.

It is in competention of governments to decline negative effect of air travelling by producing special laws to control air travelling.

In conclusion, I would like to underline that travelling by planes has it's dangerous effect on our health, for example, get lags make us feel bored and tired and crushes our biological watches.

The given diagram demonstrates how changed the investment in renewable energy in period from 2006 to 2013.

 As it can be seen, the line of the whole world investment was rising every year till 2011.

In period from 2009 to 2011 it was up very high to 279 $Bn what was the highest of the all years.

As for developed and developing countries, the situation on the given diagram is almost the same.

From 2006 to 2011 the investment was rising and after the highest point in 2011 it started to go down.

However, in 2009 in developed countries the investment in renewable energy was lower than two years ago.

Unlike developed countries, in developing countries the highest point of the investment was in 2012.

 Thus, from the graph it can be seen that in developed countries the investment was higher a lot than in developing countries.

The graph line and bar chart shows and summarise changes in investment in renewable energy in worldwide in the period between 2006 to 2013 in developing and developed countries and also shows world total.

As we can see from the graph world total investment grown constantly all over the period and reached the peak in 2011 with 279 $ bn and the minimum in 2006 with 100 $ bn total.

 Instead of developing countries indicators : the bar chart was increasing all over the period from 2006 to 2012 and then decreased in 2013 from 103 $ bn to 90 $ bn total.

In brief, the world and developed countries investment graph line is very similar and selecting ad summarise information we can say that developed countries were general investers in renewable energy from 2006 to 2013.

There is an opinion that when people travel by plan, they increase air pollution and influence negative on global warming.

To my mind, there are a lot of other things which pollute our planet more and less important for society.

I recon, state should make plant more inviromentally-friendly and it help more then to reduce the amount of air ravel.

Moreover, I strongly believe that people can create new technologies for air travel and they decrease emission of plan of, what will be really successful, find new type of power.

Some people can say that there are other ways of transport and they more inviromentaly friendly.

All form of transport have many problems but I think that air traveling is the best way in any condition.

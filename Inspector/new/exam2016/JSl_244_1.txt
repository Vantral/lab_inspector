The global trend for the number of children without access to primary education is undoubtedly downward, with a decrease by 11 million children in Africa, a decrease by 21 million children in South Asia, and, correspondingly, a decrease by 7 million children in the rest of the world.

The situation seems to have improved in South Asia and the rest of the world, whereas in Africa there were more girls than boys without primary education in 2012 ( 18,2 million and 14,5 million, correspondingly).

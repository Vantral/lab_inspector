Besides, it is worth noticing the trend that both in Africa and in South Asia (similarly with the rest world) there had a significant decline in the number of chidren who could not attend elementary school.

Thus, by 2012 South Asia had uneducated children less than Africa had and the rest of World had (approximately five millions of boys and the same number of girls).

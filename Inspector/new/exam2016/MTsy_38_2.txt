In recent years it has proven that air travel is dangerous for the atmosphere and was recognised that many air travels were not necessary.

In my opinion, I mostly agree with this point of view, which based on decreasing of the amount of air travel.

Aircraft engins emit heat, particularities and gases, which have negative influence on atmosphere and only government can protect the planet from global warming.

Moreover, unnecessary air travelling, which includes short trips on airplanes for 2 4 hous, should be restricted or banned, because it is possible to use more ecological train, for example.

In conclusion, air pollution must be restricted because of damaging influence on our nature and government should take care of it and introduce some measures like higher taxes or restrictions on short distanse air travel for leisure, but laws can not covered or include businessman.

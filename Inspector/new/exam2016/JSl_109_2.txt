Firstly, old companies, wich have exosted in the market for a long time, can create monopoly on the goods or services what they products for a majority of people this is not very useful because people would like that in the market will be many goods and services and they can chose one of them withe a brilliant of perfect quality, the second minus is that the economy of the country where company moved busines to poorer and developing country, can decline because one of the important parts of the economy and international policy moved to poorer.

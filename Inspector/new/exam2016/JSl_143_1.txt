The graph illustrates how the investment in renewable energy changed from 2006 to 2013 in developing and developed countries and in the world in total.

An interesting feature is that both developed and developing countries' investments were slowly growing and reached the peak of approximately 180 and 100$ bn in 2011.

One distinguishing feature which differs developing countries from developed is that their investments were continuing to increase after 2011.

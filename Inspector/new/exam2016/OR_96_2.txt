Secondly, there are sorts of products that have extremely short life expectancy what makes plane only appropriate kind of transport for this type of goods.

They are in favour of reducal of civil air travelling because the share of air travel for business and leisure purposes is rather higher than state one.

Though I agree with this opinion only up to a point I would rather restrain myself in other needs than to refuse from air travel.

To sum up, I want to state that air travel is not the only one cause of air pollution and I wish environmentalist to concentrate on other pollutants instead of violating right for freedom in movement.

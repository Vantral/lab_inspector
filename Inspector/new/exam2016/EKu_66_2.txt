In today's fast-moving world many people maintain that the most effective way to reduce amount of crimes is to keep those who committed a crime in prison for a longer time.

First of all, people in prisons live in very poor conditions and under very strict rules which they have to obey, the get bad food and they can be hitted by their roommates or even by policemen.

I believe that living in such conditions can not affect person in a good way, he or she will not be better after all prison sentence even if it is longer, and we definitely can not claim that after the prison this thief or a merder won't commit a crime again.

I think this help also will be relevant for prisoners, because many of them comitted crimes for such psycological reasons.

To sum up, I would like to say that alternative ways of reducing crime have more benifits than drawbacks, and not every person has to be sent in prison for longer time in order to understand his fault.

And someone thinks that a lot of air travel is unnecessary, that is why governments should regulate tha amount of air travel for business and leisure by laws.

On the one hand, air travel make a negative influence on the atmosphere such as air pollution and may be ozone holes.

In long term it ill be dangerous for all people and that is why governments ought to introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel.

For example, they can introduce quotes for air travel on the other hand, there are a lot of different things that provides air pollution and global warming more than air travel for example, cars and volcans.

About the influence of cars, we know but not everyone knows that after the booming voulcan's gas pollute the air more than cars and air travelling in comparison for several years, and its is one of the main reason of global warming.

Air travel is new way of transport and there are not so many air travelling.

I think that there are different reasons of air also have to be regulated by government.

I mean control of air travel in long term period and including different ways of reducing the rate of air pollution and global warming.

In my opinion government should care about all the problems that connected with nature, because for air companies and its holders saving our nature doesn't give and benefit.

So the laws like high tax rates will help to reduce negative impact on air and get money for cleaning it that will increase the utility of government.

To conclude I want to notice that government should use its institutions to improve the welfare of its citizens and I strongly believe that high tax rates on air companies will help to save our nature and protect us from other unconsidered consequenses of global warming.

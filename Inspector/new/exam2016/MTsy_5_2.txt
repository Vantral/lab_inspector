Speaking about air travels we can see that it involve air pollution and grobal warming because of burning fuel that sent into atmosphere.

I agree with the position that amount of air travels should become less, because harmful things that sent into the atmosphere during burning the fuel are cause some issues such as global warming, air polution.

On the one hand banning some air trips help to decrease harmful consequances for nature, but it can not solve the problem.

Fmom my point of view goverment should introduce laws that support science which create ecological fuel, for example, machines that worked on water.

If the government introduce laws that reduce the amount of car travels, it will be more useful, because there are a lot of cars and partiqurary everyone have a car.

In conclusion, I would like to say that the introducing laws that reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure is not useful because there are a lot of another harmful transport that have bad influence on environment.

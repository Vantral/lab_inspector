Nowadays there are people who think that air travel contribute to air pollution and global warming and an amount of air travel should be decreased.

However, there is a group of people who are absolutely convinced that it is not necessary to reduce the number.

In my opinion, traveling by plain makes less damage to our earth rather than cars.

As an example we can look in statistics and search that cars give much more oxygen in the air.

Furthermore, air travelling is the safest type of travelling.

As an example, there was a TV program in which was said that more than 2 million of people die in auto crashes or train crashes each year and only less than 0,005% of air flights are finished by crash.

Moreover, air travelling is the most comfortable and the fastest type of travelling, because you can reach each point of the world in less than 20 hours.

Nevertheless, there are people who tell that travelling by plane contribute to air pollution because of the fuel which air companies use.

Also, they are sure that the main cause of global warming is air travelling because there are to many unnecessary flights.

I do not agree with this opinion because I have read information on the website of the Russian air travelling company, named Aeroflot, that in a few years they are going to start using another type of fuel which will less polute air.

Also, it's known that travelling by car contribute more to air pollution and global warming because of gazes.

To sum up, I want to say that air travelling is still developing.

In a few years it will less polute our world and it will become more safier than it is now, that is why goverment should not to introduce the law which reduce the number of air flights.

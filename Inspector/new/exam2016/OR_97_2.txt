It is a well-knows fact that due to ongoing globalization processes, which have already taken over the majority of our business society, more and more people tend to use planes to move around the places.

However, the other side of the coin is that such mean of transport is considered to be alarmingly damaging to the atmosphere so that stricter law regulation is needed to be introduced.

I am, being the active user of an air travel on a regular basis, fully convinced that the world society should simply put up with the fact that air pollution is an unavoidable and natural process.

Consequently, it is high time governments thought towards the issue of how to decline the level of harm brought by air travel instead of cutting off the number of flights.

Then, there is a fact that the number of incidents connected with air travel is considerably smaller in comparison with other means of transport.

On the other hand, introducing governmental programmes aimed at a reduction of the bad impact that planes may have on the atmosphere can be quite expensive.

In this case, cutting the number of air flights seems to be logical and understandable.

All in all, it is entirely up to the governmental experts to decide whether the introduction of a stricter law regulation will contribute to the nature or not.

I am considering such measures as the waste of time and resources so that I vote against cutting off the amount of air travel.

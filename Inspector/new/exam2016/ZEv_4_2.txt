As it been stated, air travel has a huge influence on air pollution and global warming, so governments said that they should introduce some new laws to protect nature by reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure.

It is quite logical to fight air pollution by inventing eco-fuel, electric cars like Tesla or improving the underground.

I'm sure, that taking control of water and air pollution and noticing the global warming is possible and government can make it correctly to protect everyone.

Some people believe that nowadays airplanes exremly infuence the air pollution and that global warming depends on the number of airplanes, while other people think that air travel for business and leisure can not influence the results of global world changes.

First of all, I also believe that air travel play a role in the world pollution, because it is like a car or a bus has some influence on the air.

Moreover, in our modern society the majority of famous people have their own airplane and they do a lot of unnecessary air trips.

And, of course, government have to control the number of air travel per day to save our planet and air pollution.

What is more government can introduce some laws to control air travel for leisure.

But on the other hand, I think that it is impossible, as to calculate the data about all airplanes and air travel.

What is more the majority believe that the number of air travel don not influence global warming.

However, government have to control more important areas in our country.

Take for example, medicine, education, pollution as a result of factories.

Nevertheless, it is the fact that water pollution play the most important role in global warming.

As a result, government should control not only air pollution, but it has the most important problems in our modern life.

As a result, nowadays global warming is a very important theme for some debates, but government doesn't have to forget about other problems in our countries.

In conclusion, inspite of other problems, I believe that our future time it will be some laws which will reduce the number of air travel and that it will influence the global warming on the positive sights.

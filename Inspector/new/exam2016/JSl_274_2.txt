On the other hand, entertainment context accounts for a bigger part on social networks than useful information, one reason for this is that many people see social networks as a way of relaxing during their leisure time.

A second reason is that people try to earn money from the content on the social networks sites and entertainment always attracts more audience than usefull information, such as news.

In conclusion I'd like to share my opinion on this dilemma.

I believe, that although entertaining became a crucial part of social networking model, communicating information and sharing knowledge still remains the main purpose of social networks.

In my opinion people need quick and convenient ways of transferring information and therefore, if all social networks are aimed only at entertaining people, than soon a news one will be created for people to be able to exchange messages.

Some people claim that the strategy of opening new branches of well-known highly-influential companies in developing and third-world countries is one of the best ways to fight against unemployment, whereas others assume this method to be rather useless.

First of all, by giving an opportunity of such employment to local workers is actually a whole cluster of decisions, as with this chance people may also receive extra education for their occupation and other perks such as health insurance, which is especially important for them.

Moreover, extention to poorer countries usually creates lots of blue collar offers, not only white collar once, which would have more interest in such countries, as it's often factories that's being constructed and opened in developing states.

And that distance, as supposed, has its effect on the final cost of the outcome product, which is a result of higher logistic expenses.

Still, from my point of view those extra payments don't play a big role in the final cost.

That is because labour in developing countries is way cheaper than in developed once, which means that an outcome is practically the same.

People have differing views with regard to the impact of the air transport on the natural environment as for me, I believe that airplanes do not pollute the air crucially, thus there is no necessaty to reduce the number of air travel in the world.

As it has been proven that air planes contribute to air pollution, companies should make special research programmes, in order to create an innovative, engine which will reduce the air pollution created by planes and other means of air transport.

Moreover, people usually try to arrive to the destination as soon as possible, thus they use air planes, which have a faster speed.

In the addition, it governments impose taxes on air travel, it will lead to a great increases in prices of most of the goods, it can be noticed that it will have a negative impact especially on ordinary consumers.

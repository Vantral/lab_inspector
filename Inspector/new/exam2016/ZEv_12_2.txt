To start with, it is argumental that plans do much harm to atmosphere becaus quality of fuel is constantly increasing and it is intended to be more eco-friendly.

Besides, I believe that air transport plays an important role in global transportation due to it's numerous conveniences : price, speed, ability to get difficult and far places and so on.

Finally, if authorities start to implement some regulations in favour of lower-flight policy, people probably will be shocked and will show their dissatisfaction and protest what can result in serious consequences.

However, some people disagree saying that environmental problems is the care of every citizen in modern world and we should not treat to air pollution and global warming so irresponsibly.

Nonetheless, I can not accept these opinions because every person has a choice and if his or her preference is to travel by plane and do harm to environment he should do it and should respect this choice.

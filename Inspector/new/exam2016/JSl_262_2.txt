Ones believe that social networks are aimed to information and knowledge sharing, others argue that it first of all just entertainment, in this essay I will look on both sides and provide own opinion.

On the one side, first of all, the Internet was created as a place, where people have an opportunity to communicate and share information staying at different points of a world.

For example in such sites as Facebook or Vkontakte people can find and enter different interesting community where they will have a chance to communicate with people with the same interests of views.

On the other side, social networks also play a role of entertainment for many people.

And of course social media represent a place where people can relax : read different stories and, funny pictures, listen to favorite music.

All things are considered and I partly agree with both sides.

I tend to believe that social networks : play multy-fanctional role and everyone decides, how he will rise it.

From my point of view the best variant is to strike a balance between using the Internet for entertainment and information sharing.

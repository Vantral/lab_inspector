That is why the government should make laws that will reduce the amount of air travel because not all of them are necessary.

More important, I am sure that such kind of travelling will not pollute the environment because such transport will work at the alternative enerdy such as solar, wind and waves.

To sum up, I would like to say that we shouldn't cancel all the flights despite the fact that they pollute the atmosphere.

However, the government can reduse the number of them because some people can comfortably use land transport such as trains or subways.

 Speaking about the amount of money spent on investment in that field in developed and developing countries, it can be seen that in 2006 developing countries contributed only 25% of the worldwide investment, but it grew stadily up to about 1/3 of total money spent on renewable energy in 2009 and remained stable with slight fluctuations to 2013.

Overall, after analysing the information given it can be stated that the worlwide amount of investment in renewable energy rose from 100 billion dollars in 2006 to 2014 billion dollars in 2013, at the same time demonstrating that developing countries started to play much more important role in renewable energy investment since 2008, contributing about 1/3 of the world total investment in renewable energy.

There is an opinion that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences.

Of course, it is one of the best way of punishment, but other people believe that for reducing the crime there are better and alternative ways.

On the one hand, I can agree that prison sentences are the best way to punish the criminals, but for some of them prison is not a big problem and they can repeat their criminal activities again.

And it can be repeated for many times.

For this reason, the longer prison sentences can help to decrease the number of criminality.

Also, long-time prisoners may understand their faults in case of having more time of not-free life.

But, on the other hand, there are alternative ways of reducing crime which can be included in our lives.

Of course, it may be new laws and also for all the genders and nationalities.

A bigger amount of police also can help country to reduce more crime.

Unfortunately, nowadays the big proportion of criminals is not under the punishment of law and most of them can protect themselves from prison sentences by money or good relationships with the judgements.

And each of us knows the examples of criminals which hadn't be given under the punishmet.

Ti sum up, we understand that longer prison sentences cannot be the only solution for this problem, but it can be an addition to other methods.

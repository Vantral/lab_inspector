It can be deduced from the graph that the biggest investment was made by developed countries, nearly always counting more than 100 $ Bn.

The lowest level of their input was made at the very beginning of the period, counting approximately 80 $ Bn, while the biggest amount of money invested was made in 2011, reaching almost 170 $ Bn, showing nearly a two-time increase in comparison to 2006.

In contrast, developing countries demonstrated fewer investments in renewable energy, approximately always giving more than 50 $ Bn, showing an avarage level two times lower, than in other countries.

Developing lands invested their biggest amount of money in 2012, which counted nearly 100 $ Bn, demonstarting almost a four fold raise in comparison to 2006 with its investment approximately 25 $ Bn.

Overall, the world total of investment shows the biggest level of input in 2011, repeating the tendency of developed countries, which remained the most important source of investment during the whole perios.

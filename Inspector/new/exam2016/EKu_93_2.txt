This fact shows that there are still a vast amount of people working under the same conditions that the others who have already moved anywhere used to work.

This means that big companies are surely aware of the fact too, so in order to make the production much more cheaper they move their headquarters to the poorer countries.

Also developing countries boast of their people's stamina and hard-work so it is quite tempting to get a great workers and lessen the expenses.

Thirdly these areas exclude rivalry between big companies so they can work freely- there are much less big companies in there.

Thirdly, the legislations are quite different so in some countries it is much more easily to do something which is strictly forbidden in any other and the majority of workers are surely not aware of their rights so it is easier for companies to manipulate due to poor education level.

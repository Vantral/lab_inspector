But investments in developing countries slightly rose up year by year, when the number of investments in developed countries was always different and did not show a stability.

Finaly, taking everything into consideration, the main tendency of this graph is the fact that developed countries have make investments in renewable energy than developing countries, but in last years the number of investments fall down, which integrated in the number worldwide investments.

I strongly agree that countries and states from all over the world have to provide and organize in order to decline air-flights.

To begin with, today we can see that the majority of departures and air-flights are consisted of only half of all passengers, who want to go to travel.

So government should explain companies related to transportation in the air, that they have to decline everyday flights.

Secondly, reducing the number of travelling by air-transport can help to short crushes that happens so often today.

However, people believe that it is very important to save the number of air-flights and government and states do not need to have a deal with air companies.

Firstly, it is so comfortable for people to take a flight, whenever they need it.

For example, if a person is a businessman, he can be in need to be in 3 hours in the other place of the world.

Probably, this happens because of the lack of statistics and information about today's situation with environment.

To sum up, today it is a very important to care about environment, because we have to think about myself, but about the next generations.

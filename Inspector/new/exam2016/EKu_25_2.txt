The problem of economical and ethical priorities in business is getting more and more actual nowadays.

More and more companies move from developed countries to poorer ones to employ local workers.

Whether there are more pros than contras in the idea of employment local workers is a contraversial question worth discussing.

There are some people who believe that it is a good way of development to employ the workers in poorer countries.

To begin with, their work is much cheaper, which definitely helps a company to save a huge amount of money.

In addition, if the work does not demand any professional qualities and qualification, it seems that there will be no difference in the product.

Moreover, often it happens that the amount of money that an international company offers to local workers is much higher that the average salary in a certain region in a poor country, so the workers themselves can benefit from such employment.

However, some people are sure that the disadvantages of this idea outweigh the advantages.

First, the tempation of the company to save money can often lead to the decrease in quality of their product.

Second, the ethical reasons are important, too : work conditions in such placements usually are awful and can even be out of the law, so the workers suffer from the job; moreover, they cannot even protect their rights because it is a too complicated process in developing countries.

In conclusion, the question whether it is beneficial for an international company to employ local workers is rather actual and has a lot of arguments from both sides.

Personally, I believe that in this question the main thing is the rights of the workers and the ability for them to work normally and be paid honestly.

Hopefully, in the future the work conditions for local employees will be so appropriate, that this question will lose its ambiguity.

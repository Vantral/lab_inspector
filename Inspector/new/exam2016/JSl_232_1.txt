The number of such girls is near twice bigger than the number of boys in South Asia by 2000 - 21,6 compared to 11,1.

By 2012 number of children from this region without access to primary education rapidly decreased from 32,7 to 9,9 more than 3 times lower.

The changes in number of girls and boys are also the highest compared to other regions : 16,8 and 6 respectively.

In my essay I am going to examine this question from both points of view.

On the one hand there are those who argue that the best way to reduce crime is to make prison sentences longer.

The main reason for believing this is the fact that longer sentences will make criminals think more and hesitate more while having in intention to commit a crime.

It is also worth pointing that the violent and mentally ill people will be isolated from the society for a longer period and this increases safety of the civilians.

On the other hand, there are people who think that the humanity should search for alternative ways to make the crime level decrease.

They think so because not letting the crimes happen is a better and an easier way to reduce crime.

It is more efficient to create a better social environment, and try to fight against social unsatisfaction, which leads to the main part of the crimes, than to punish criminals with longer prison sentences.

I can add that it is scientifically proved that severe punishments such as really long sentences or death do not reduce the crime levels.

Also, there is always a risk of the judgement mistake and the person who is not guilty will suffer from it.

As we can see, there are no simple answers to this question.

In balance, however, I tend to believe that alternative ways to solve this problem are better, because it seems to me more efficient not to let the crime happen, then to make the punishment more severe.

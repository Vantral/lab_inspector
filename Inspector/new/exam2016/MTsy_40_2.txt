Nowadays, there is an opinion that governments should control travels by plans because of their harmful influence on the atmosphere and our enviroment.

The last but not least reason why air travels should not be controled is existence of other sources of pollution which are more dangerous.

There are amounts of manufactures which influence air and global warming more harmful than gas of airplans.

I strongly believe that goverment should pay attention to pollution from earth transports and manufactures because their negative influence is well-known and does not bring usility like plans.

Similarly, the bar chart presents that the investment in renewable energy in developed countries reached the highest point in 2011; afterwards the amount of investment also started gradually decreasing, up to 2013.

Overall, in can be stated that the most huge sums of money was spended on renewable energy in 2011 (according to total world line and the level of developed countries), while the peak in developing countries was reached late - in 2012.

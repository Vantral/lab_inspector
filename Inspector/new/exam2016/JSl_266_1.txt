All in all, the average time declines significantly from younger to older generations.

However, men's graph rapidly plunges offer at the age of 24 from 282,1 minutes to 153,8 minutes and only ten becomes rather steady in case of falling women's numbers (and graph formed by them) decrease slightly and even remain unchanged between ages 25 44.

The graph indicates how the amount of money spent on renewable energy by two types of countries, developed and developing, and by the world in general changed between 2006 and 2013.

Overall, the most striking feature of the graph is that it mainly shows an upward trend with a relatively great decline between years 2011 and 2013.

It also noticeable that developed countries tend to invest twice as much money in renewable energy comparing to developing states.

The peak of the investments was registered in 2011 when 279 Bn dollars was put into the energy that can be renewed.

2011 is also the year when developed countries invested the largest amount of money in this kind of energy.

However for developing countries the year of major investment is the next year, the year 2012.

It is seen that the amount of money spent on energy was rising gradually from2006 to 2011, however, throught the following two years the number of investments decreased, reaching the mark of 214, 150 and 90 Bn dollars in the world, developed and developing countries respectively.

As over more people stat to talk about air pollution and global warming, some persons argued that the amount of air travel should be reduced to keep out nature.

Firstly, a lots of business processes depend on flights and some of them will not function as fast as they could be in case of reducing of air travels.

For instance, in countries with a small amount of flight people use other transport and because of that the statistics of depth during the traveling is worse then in other countries.

At conclusion I would say that in contemporary world people need to have a lots of air travel as they develop very fast and the most fastest way of traveling must be exist.

I equally agree with both of these statements, but I think that governments should provide special laws to cut down the amount of air travelling.

On the other hand, there are a lot of standards for ecologically friendly airplanes and airports.

Providing more stricked rules governments could gain an ability to shorten pollutions and, as a result, feel themselves calm about ecological system future.

Despite having these potential resolutions for reducing the amount of air travel there are features and cases which stand unchangeable.

For example, all businessmen and businesswomen can't reduce using airplanes due to stricked time schedule - each extra minute could cost extra millions expenditures for them.

To sum up, I agree with the statement about government initiatives to introducing laws, which can frame the amount of using air travelling for business and leisure.

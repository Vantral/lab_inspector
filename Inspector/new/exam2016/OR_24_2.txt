First of all, it is quite understandable that the air travel is not only one cause of pollution and global warming.

That is why government should not only airplanes to decline number of travel, but and for others polluted factors.

Secondly, if government will control the amount of business air travel and tourism, than people can be agrassive.

In conclusion, I should say that government should pay its attention on rather sphere for regulation problem like air pollution, not only one, government should provide some educational program about that.

Some scientists say, that a lot of air travel causes senting pollution into the atmosphere and as a result, a global warming.

What is why, in order to protect our planet from global warming governments should take some measures.

Perhaps, reducing the amount of air travel is one of these point, but from my point of view, it should be done as one of the last measure.

 In conclusion, I would like to say, that I think, intriducing laws to reduce the amount of air travel is generally unnecessary in the modern world because it can cause a lot of uncomfortabilities for many people.

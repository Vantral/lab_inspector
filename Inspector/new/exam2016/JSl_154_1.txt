Both of these bar chart and line graph illustrate changes in financial way of renewable energy in developed, developing countries and in the whole world between 2006 and 2013.

As can be seen during this graph an amount of investments in developed countries increased gradually from 2006 and reached a peak $ 170 bn in 2011.

Then it started to drop and it was at the point of $ 130 bn in 2013.

In developing countries this trend also went up and peaked at $ 105 bn in 2012 and later declined to $ 85 bn.

It is clear that an amount of financial way of renewable energy was higher in developed countries rather than in developing.

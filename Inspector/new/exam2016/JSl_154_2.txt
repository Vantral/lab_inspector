On the other hand, tutoring by developing countries have a negative side because they don't give them a chance of developing by their own.

So, they try to make a decisions beyond developing countries and moving business into developing countries can lead to losing the historical of that place.

They can make a descision of developing the structure, society and economic of these countries, that can be a reason of dying the personal opinion and point of view.

In sum, from my point of view there are more advantages of moving business by international companies to developing countries rather than disadvantages.

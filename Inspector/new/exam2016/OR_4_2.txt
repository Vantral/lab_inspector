Some people consider that it loods to air pollution and global warming and government should create special law to decrease the number the number of planes fly.

What about business, it very convenient for people to go to the other countries or even countinents for emergency.

On the other hand, air travel is one of the reason of air pollution or maybe worse global warming.

In some cases, it is a good idea to have some laws about it.

Of course, government can't forbit all the air travels, but it could allow people to fly with high taxes.

What is more, government should improve alternatives, for example, new comfortable trains with 1st class.

In conclusion, I want to say that it is necessary to reduce the number of air travel, but it could be done correctly.

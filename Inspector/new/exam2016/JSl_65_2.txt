To begin with, there are a lot of benefits when international companies move and appear in poor countries.

The next reason why it is a good idea to move international companies in these countries is that developing countries start to develop faster.

However, there are some disadvantages of this process.

One of them is a bad condition of work in poorer countries.

For instance, it is very hard to make business in Tunasia because there are a lot of deserts, a lack of nature and other factors in this area.

In addition, a lot of people in developing countries do not have special education.

in other words, it is very hard to employ local workers and find persons who graduated from universities.

For example, the level of illiteracy in Tunasia is one of the highest in the world and businessmen do not want to move their companies to this developing country.

Nowadays, it is very trendy to move huge international companies to developing countries all over the world and employ poor local people there.

However, it seems to me that the advantages of this improvement or development outweigh the disadvantages and it is a very good idea to move business to poorer countries and employ local people.

In the graph is represented here we can see how investment in renewable Energy differs in the period from 2006 and to 2013 worldwide.

First, it can be seen that investments are rising from the beginning of observations to 2008, where it reached 171 $ bn.

After small decreasing, it started to grow significantly from 2009 until it reached its peak in 2011 and counts about 279 $bn.

They show changes particularly in developed countries and developing ones.

Generally, it is obvious that developed countries have bigger statistics of using investments than developing countries in the whole period is depicted.

Another thing is that bar charts have quite the same trends as the worldwide graph does, but histograms have splitted values.

Summarizing all the information, it can be said that a world total changes are quite significant and sharp.

Considering just the same information, but in cases of two types of countries, the one thing is significant is that investments in renewable energy are bigger in developed countries and the difference between such sort of countries and the developing ones is approximately 50 75 $ bn per year.

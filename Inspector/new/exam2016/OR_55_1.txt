We also can see that in each region there was a decline in the amount of children during the represented period.

As it is evident from the bar chart there is a great difference between South Asia 2000 and South Asia 2012 equal to 6 millions in case of boys and about 16 millions in case of girls.

The colums "rest of world" give us an information that in Africa the number of described category is doubl the number in the rest of world, it is true as in 2000 as as in 2012.

In Asia this amount became so small that it is now less then in the rest of world.

To sum it all up, we can see from the bar chart that there is huge difference between the number of children without primary school education in different years and in different regions.

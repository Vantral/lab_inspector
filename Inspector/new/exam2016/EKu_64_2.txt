Bringing western rules of medical insurance and work schedule for employees to the developing countries is not only about providing these people with job, but also teaching them that a company should care about its workers and provide them with medicine, breaks and days-off.

 Bringing big businesses in developing countries has its pros and cons, still, I believe, that physical and psychological issues that workers face sometimes are not that common to stop this practice for it provides millions of people with stable job which means food and education for their families and decent working conditions for the workers themselves.

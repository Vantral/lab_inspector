In the graph the main changes of the process of investment in renewable energy all over the world is shown.

We can see that countries are divided into two groups (developed and developing).

There is also a line of world total, all this information illustrates the tendentions of investment in different countries between 2006 and 2013.

First of all, it is easily to notice that developed countries during the research invested more money in energy companies.

The pick of it was in 2011 when the amount of money donated to the environmental program reached more than 150 bn $.

Developing countries also payed attention to it, however, as it could be seen from the graph, amount of money invested in, during the same time period, always was much more less.

The pick of activity of developing countries was in 2012 when it reached a little bit more than 100 bn $.

The main trend of the graph was the sharp rise of amount of money since 2009 and to 2011.

After there was a dramatic decline until 2013.

Analyzing information from two graphs we could claim that the world total investments in renewable energy totally depended on developed countries activity.

In conclusion, it is clearly seen that the world pick of activity happened in the same time when developed countries invested the most amount of money in renewable energy.

It can be deduced from the illustrated bar chart, representing both developed and developing countries, that the investment in renewable energy in developing countries significantly increased from approximately 25 Bn dollars in 2006 to 100 Bn in 2012, obviously, illustrating a fourth-time growth.

However, in 2013 the amont of money invested in renewable energy sources dropped to about 85 Bn dollars.

Similarly, developed country investment in renewable energy significantly increased from about 65 Bn dollars in 2006 to 180 Bn dollars, so investment raised in almost three times.

Furthermore, as in developing countries, the investment decreased for about 50 Bn dollars.

Speaking about worldwide investment in renewable energy sources it could be seen that, as in developed countries, the amount of money invested signifacantly increased from 100 Bn dollars in 2006 to approximately 300 Bn dollars in 2011.

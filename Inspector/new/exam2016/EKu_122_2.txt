Many people believe that the best way to make amount of crimes less is to give longer prison sentences.

I can agree with this statement due to several reasons.

First of all, crime itself is a big sin because it is unfair to do bad things to other people.

I believe that if a person who break the law has to pay for this and there would not be any exception.

For instance, in Russia if a person kills someome he/she can be pisoned for only 10 years.

I think, it is not an appropriate sentence and it must be prolonged.

In addition, when a prisoner comes back in "normal" life, he can not normally live.

It happens because he/she already has bad feautes and he/she can do a crime again.

Also, other part of society can not trust ex-prisoned people, therefore they have a problem to find a job, thus they can become bulglars due to a lack of money.

On the other hand, some people believe that there are alternative ways of reducing crime.

For instance, many of them organize some meetings to help ex-prisoners to cope with return to a 'nornal' life.

Some say that these meetings really help people to recover both mentally and physically after their life in prison.

It is a pity that in the most of cases it does not help and ex-prosiners break the law again.

To sum it up, there are more advantages in keeping law breakers longer in prison.

It can be a really effective way to reduce crime and to make safety for society, because a lot of people who were in prison make crimes over and over again.

The given line graph depicts the amount of money spent on renewable energy between 2006 and 2013 by the whole world wide.

As for as the line graph in concerned, the investment experienced a rapid growth during the first 2-year-period from 100 $ bn to 171 $ bn.

Developing countries showed continuous growth reaching a peak in 2012, as opposed to developed countries' peak in 2011, and then started to fall.

Overall, what stands out from the figures is that not only apparently developed countries spent more money on renewable energy sources than developing ones, but also that world total investment in this area correlated with countries of developed level in a considerable way.

Furthermore, moving businesses abroad provides local workers with jobs which are often hard to find in a developing country.

On the other hand, there are some people who argue that replacing business in other countries has more drowbacks.

According to their point of view, moving companies production abroad leads to the higher level of unemployment in a country where this company originates from.

However, I can not agree with them as nowadays people living in developed countries have no wish to do unqualified jobs.

Talking everything into account I would like to point out that moving international companies' businesses to poorer countries has more benefits for people living in both developed and developing countries and also for the producers of goods.

By placing the business abroad we provide locals with jobs, stimulate their economy and earn more money to develop the production of goods.

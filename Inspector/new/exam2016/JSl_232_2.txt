To begin with, sometimes the air space is "overcrowded" by flying planes, what definitely leads to air pollution.

To reduce the number of these planes governments have to introduce the special law that lets use private air travel only with a permission.

Making better qualities and characteristics of planes will probably makes them less harmful to the extremal area and will reduce their amount in the air.

It can be seen from the graph that from the 2006 to 2008 renewable energy was sponsored steadly in both types of countries,including the whole world, rising the investment`s level.

Overall, world`s total and both developed and developing countries show the same shemes of investment`s movements, fluctuating and differing just in the whole amount of money, spending on the innovations in renewable sourses of energy.

The diagramm below illustrates indexes of children who can not get a primary school education in a period 2000/2012 by sex and part of children and the horizontal axes is measured in proportion of males and females and years.

Analysing the statistics in 2000, it is clear that the indexes was huge and the pick of children's number was in Africa and equaled almost 45 millions.

The level of boys was significantly lower during this period than the level of girls.

Looking at the data in 2012, we can define that indexes in South Asia and Rest of World are much more lower than the Africa index.

Overall, it is definitely clear that there was a tendency that the number of children was decreasing during this period in all regions.

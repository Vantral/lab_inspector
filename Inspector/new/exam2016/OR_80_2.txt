On the one side, air travel can cause air pollution and global warming, but in the other side, travelling by air is the most convenient and fastest mean of transport.

Moreover, it results reducing of the oxygen and ozone procentage in the air which means that it is really hard to breathe freely.

People believe that it is more likely to travel with children by plane because it is not so energy consuming like travelling by train or bus.

To my mind, governments should reduce the amount of flights as it is harmful for the environment.

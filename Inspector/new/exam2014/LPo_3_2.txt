First of all, such condition makes the competitive entry fair due to the fact that boys and girls have similar chances to get the place at University.

This is definetly valuable, because at work collectives are usually mixed, so they have to be ready to became a part of such environment.

Thirdly, in the classes where the numbers of male and female students are equal the atmosphere seems to be more peaceful and relaxed.

This will give opportunity for greater number of girls to enter successfully maths subjects, at the same time more boys will be able to be accepted in subjects like Literature and History.

Taking everything into consideration, I would like to restate my previous opinion and say that accepting the same numbers of men and women in every subject should be a rule for universities.

It is obvious that the oldest metro system is the oldest metro system is the more kilometres of route it has.

As for the number of passengers per year, the leading metro system is in Tokyo (1927 millions), and the least number of passangers per year is in Kyoto (only 45 millions), and it is clear that the figures difference is significant (more than 40 times).

The graph and the pie chart below illustrate the use of electricity in winter and in summer days and describe for what it is usually used in England.

A holistic view at the data provides with information that in winter daily demand for electricity is much higher than that in summer.

By the way, more than a half of electricity is used for heating rooms and water, that is why in winter the demand for it is higher.

A closer look at the provided information reveals that people use equal quantity of electricity both for entertainment (TV, radio) and home duties (vacuum cleaning, using electric tools).

We can also see that consumnation of electricity both in winter and in summer changes a little, so the gap between winter demand and summer demand stays approximately the same.

To sum up, people use a lot of electricity during the days for heating their homes and entertainment, but in winter the demand for electricity is higher than that in summer.

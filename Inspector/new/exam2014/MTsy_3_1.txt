The information illustrated on the pictures is about comparison of age categories in population of two countries : Yemen and Italy in 2000 and 2050 years.

As we can see the bigger part of population in Yemen in 2000 year consisted from 0 14 years and 15 59 years old people, while there was only 3,6% of eldest generation.

The prediction is that by 2050 year the number of middle generation (15 59 years old group) will increase.

In Italy is a little bit different situation.

In 2000 year the eldest generation occured approximately a quarter of all population and only 14,3% consisted from the youngest generation.

And by 2050 percent of more than 60 years old people will continue to rise and will be 42,3%.

All in all, we can say that in Yemen population will be younger and in Italy it is an opposite effect, because population become older.

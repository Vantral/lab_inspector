On the first graph the corelation between student's age and the main reason for study is represented.

It can be clearly seen, that the amount of students studying for some career purpouses decreases with the age, and, on contrary, the number of those studying for interest increases and reaches the peak in the oldest age group.

It achieves the highest position in the age group under 26, then goes down steedly to the lowest position for the group 30 39, and grows moderately in the last two groups.

To sum up, the employer support slightly corelates with the wish of an employee to study for career purposes, but this tendency works only for young students.

However, employers are also ready to help students of old age, who are mostly studying for their own interest.

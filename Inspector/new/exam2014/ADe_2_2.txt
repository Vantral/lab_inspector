There is a tendency in the modern society of Western countries : more and more parents come to a conclusion that it is better to make their children learn as much as possible in an early ages.

To sum up, I'd like to say that of course parents should not give too much work to do for their children, letting them feel the spirit of fun freedom but they should not forget that starting learning some science, languages is a very good start for children to develop themselves.

Therefore, some people suggests that the increasing the number of sports facilities can help to solve this problem, but others convince that there are shoul be other measures.

But in my mind such people are wrong in some fact.

In my point of view, we can do sports exercises not only in special sport facilities, but also at home or just run in parks, so, man`s health are often depends from himself.

As was mentioned, other people suggests that sports facilities would have little effect on public health and there are should be other facts or motivations.

Of course, other measures are necessary, for instance the healthy food, the conditions of living and so on, but I believe that sports buildings and in general, motivation to do sport will have quite significant influence on public health.

So, to sum up, I want to repeat that both views are right in some extent.

In my opinion, sports facilities really can help tp improve public health and motivate people to do sports, but there are undoubtebly should exists other facts - mainly, man`s wants to be healthy.

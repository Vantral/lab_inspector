First of all, people finished high school do not have enough skills to work before the university.

So, their knowledge is pretty low and they are not able to understand what they want, Secondly, when this year between high school and university is over, the person can understand, that studying skills are already lost, that he is not able to continue education because of the fact that he just forgot how to do it.

Possibly, it is better not to change your workplace only because you do not have enough skills, may be it is better to change studyplace and in the end to find a place that is perfectly suitable for you.

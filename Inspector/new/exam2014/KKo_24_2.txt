There are lots of discussions these days about high school programmes.

People want to give their children the best possible education, so they are widely discussing the education standards, programmes and lows, but there is some thinking to be done about events and activities happening outside the class, for example, some people believe that one of compulsory parts of high school education should be a unpaid community service, which involves working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood and other.

In my opinion, having such project as s part of high school education is a really good idea.

Students will gain a lot of experience which will help them during their lives, an experience they would never receive in the classroom.

They will have a chance to work and communicate with different people, not only gaining useful knowledge and experience, but also improving their socialization and communication skills.

This programme would also be benefitable for the charities, which often don't have enough people to achieve their goals, and for the whole community in general.

There are also people who don't want their children to participate in such programmes.

Possible reasons for that include these : by the first, such activities may take a lot of time and concentration, thus reducing the quality of education as students will have less time to spend doing homework or revising the material.

By the second, some families may be concerned about the fact the service is meant to be unpaid, not allowing students to gain some work experience and earn some money.

In conclusion, the idea to have an unpaid community service as compulsory part of high school programmes seems really appealing to me, because not only students will benefit from these activities, but also the whole community and society.

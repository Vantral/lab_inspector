This means that these systems have been developing since the previous century and, as a result, have longer routs.

Concerning three other cities, it is noticeable that the length of rout and the amount of passengers per year in Washington DC are significantly higher than in Kyoto and in Los Angeles.

In conclusion, the highest levels of kilometres of route and of the number of passengers per year have the cities, which were opened earlier than others.

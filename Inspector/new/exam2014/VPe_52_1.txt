If we look at the graph, which demonstrates Japan's trend, we will see, that from 1940 to 1960 here was a small downward trend which then led to 20-years stability.

Now, if we compare the Sweden situation and American one, despite they developed practically the same way, Sweden, first, was lower than the USA, but in the future it is demonstrated, that Sweden will gather paces and will be ahead of America.

To sum it up, the Japan trend has its own way of development and Sweden's and America's trends have something in common.

In the future it is predicted that the absolute leader of the proportion of population aged 65 and over will be Japan at the level of 30%, then it will be Sweden with its 25%, and how it sounds strange, America will be the last.

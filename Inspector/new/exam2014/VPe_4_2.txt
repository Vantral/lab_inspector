Many young adults now tend to take a gap year after finishing high school which is usually devoted to them getting some work experience or travelling around the world.

Another benefit of taking one year off before going to University is an opportunity to get many soft-skills such as foreign language speaking or confident usage of computer which are very much valued by employers.

 Speaking about the disadvantages of taking a gap year, the only one that I see is loosing one year devoted to working or travelling instead of starting your Bachelor's degree studies earlier.

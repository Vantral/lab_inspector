Demand in winter has a fall at 30000 units of electricity in the morning and reachs a pick at 10 p.

If we compare the graph and the pie chart, we will catch that amounts of electricity used on winter depends on what kind of purposes it is used for.

Other purposes are linked with home cleaning, for example the work of washing machines or vacuum cleaners, or just having fun (watching TV).

So we can see that the demand of electricity strongly depends on season and tipe of tools and machines inhabitants of England use.

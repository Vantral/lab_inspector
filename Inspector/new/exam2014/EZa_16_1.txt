We are given the chart that illustrate an average level of electricity consume in winter and summer in England and pie-chart that provides a reasons of it's using.

Despite an overall jumping of the graph, the figures are characterized by a number of peaks and thoughts.

Firstly, it hits a peak in the winter's evenings, when it reach more then 40000 units.

To conclude, I would like to say that electricity is one of the most important factors in everyday life it's hard to imagine our being without it.

The graph gives us information about amount f electricity consumed in winter and in summer during whole day, and the pie chart shows the percentage balance accordings to what the electricity is used for.

The graph hit a peack at the mare of 42 43 thousands units of electricity, and than we can see the slight fall.

All in all, the points demand for electricity in winter is in 1,5-e times higher than in summer and at least half of this electricity is used to heating.

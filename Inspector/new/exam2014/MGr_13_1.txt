In average English home the highest percentage of the electricity is used for heating rooms and heating water (52,5%).

The 15% of the electricity are for lighting, TV and radio and, alse, 15% are used for some electric tools like vacuum cleaners, food mixers and etc.

Overall, we can see that typical daily demand for electricity is bigger in winter than summer.

First of all, a free time between school and university spent, for example, travelling all over the world or working in some company or factory is a great opportunity not only to see some beautiful holiday destinations in a tropical country or accustoming to a working place, but also a wonderful time to cultivate tolerance to other cultures and traditions.

To sum it up, having a gap year has both advantages and disadvantages and it is absolutely up to a person to decide whether to do so or not, because it is all depends on mental abilities and a cultural background of up bringing.

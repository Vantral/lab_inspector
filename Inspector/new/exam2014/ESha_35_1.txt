 To begin with, the main characteristics of the countries at the start of the period are that Yemen's population is mostly divided between children up to 14 years and grown-ups under the age of 60, with a slight prevailance of youngsters and almost unconsiderable amount of elderly with 3,6%, while Italy has almost two thirds of it population (61,6%) in the working age gap and about a quarter (24,1%) of the nation is over 60 years in age, leaving 14,3% for children, as opposed to 50,1% in Yemen.

 However, tendencies of population division differ between the countries.

As predicted by scientists, both countries will see increases in elderly population percentages (arise by 2,1% and 18,2% for Yemen and Italy respectively) but meanwhile the population of Yemen is going to consist mostly of grown-ups with 57,3% while the same year gap in Italy would decrease from 61,6% to 46,2%, although remaining the biggest part of population.

 To make a conclusion, both nature of social division and the dynamics of its alterations in Italy and Yemen are diverse.

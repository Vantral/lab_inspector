On my opinion, when children start learning languages at primary school, they have more opportunities to develop their foregein skills than people who start learning foregein language at secondary school, because in secondary school children have a lot of home-work, than in primary and sometimes they don't want to learn foregein language.

But from the one hand, people who learn foregein language from primary school have a lot of positive fact, which they can use in their life, for example, they can read foregein books or magazines, watch foregein films.

On the one hand, of course, the characteristics we are born with have much more influence, because in the childhood we gove lots of important life skills.

In the childhood we have a lot of face to face conversations and we spend a lot of time with them, because of this, parents opinions and characteristics have much influence.

On the other hand experience we may have in our life is important too, because in adult we learn, how to tell with different people and of course this conversations affect on our mindset and our character.

To my mind, lots of characteristics we take in conversation with people, with different people, with other mindset and, of coure their opininion affect on us.

In conclusion I would like to say, that the characteristics we are born with have the same influence on our personality and development as any experiences we may have in our life.

Nowadays there are many various rules, which are established in universities for getting more use from modern education in developing countries and the number of students with various subject in the university are for higher but the major factor is equal demand in the field of different subjects.

It is rather difficult to divide the amount of students in equal proportions.

 However, personally I believe that both male and female should be entitled to access in every subject rather than being an equal number of genders in every subject.

| From my point of view, true universities are now full of crowded people in order for the need of their preferable subject which they want to study .

In that case, administration asseses the quality of students, which is good judgement in order to empower equally both male and female.

  But there is another point of view.

Some people think that there are a number of subjects which are always dominated by the females , as art and design course for example.

Different subjects have sundray demand according to the gender allocation.

But every student gets provided the same opportunities.

	In conclusion, I would like to stress out that student should choose the subject according his own interests and features.

It is clear, that the underground railway system in Paris has 199 kilometres of route what is twice as less as the London's metro has.

In addition it is only 11 kilometres in length, so the Kyoto's metro is the smallest one.

Overall, it is obvious, that the oldest underground railway systems are larger than the youger as well as they are able to surve more passengers.

But from the ancient times to our century there were many restrictions made by government to keep in control these famous people in order to control the society.

Many artists suffered from the government because they tried to bring new ideas to the community, make people think some other way.

This always made many problems to the government policy, because it could lead to some revolutions or local conflicts.

Using this as the main reason to keep mass media under a control, some politicians try to solve their own problems.

So the main problem of government controlling of artists is an ability of some non-honest people to influence on artists and on culture in general.

On the other hand, leaving a full freedom to artistw means that some artists can invent anything in their mind and they try to show ideas that may have a bad influence to people.

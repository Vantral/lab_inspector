The first one takes place from the 1960s to the 1980s, second growth is in the time period between the 1990s and the 2010s, then ten years until 2030 there is a slight decrease and finaly the percentage rocketing up to 25.

The growth in the USA Is ultimately milder : significant increase is between the 1960s and the 1980s and from the 1980s until the 2010s the percentage is unconsiderably fluctuating without any remarkable changes.

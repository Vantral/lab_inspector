There are different views on artists' freedom : some people people suppose, that they could do everything they want and that there shouldn not be any rules connected with this; on the other hand, there is an opinion that there should be strict social controls on creative people.

 Another argument for artists' freedom in work is that is the main feature of art process - creating something new.

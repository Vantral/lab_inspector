On the other hand, this programme actually has a few major drawbacks.

Firstly, people participating in it can just lose some important learning skills which will, in case they are hardly renewable, will mean these people are now unable to get the further education.

And just after school they are used to studying and can easily go on to get a higher education.

Secondly, the youngsters can fall in love and build a family which will also mean they are not able to carry on studying , because the family will definitely be of bigger importance than education for them.

In conclusion, I would like to say that such an opportunity should be given to people of every country and it is up to them to decide whether to postpone a higher education or to begin it immediately after finishing school.

As for me, I would definitely go for this programme , if I could , because I am still not sure what profession I am in favour of and what am I made for.

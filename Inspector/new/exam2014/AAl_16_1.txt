The first , it is necessary to note that the peak of proportion is in between 2000 and 2020, and it is 20% for Sweden .

Moreover, it is maybe to add that the proportion is slighly dicrease , and after it goes up sharply.

The second, the graph clearly shows that the proportion of Japan was not very high, but gradually it begin to grow and we can see between 2020 and 2040 how the proportion sharply grows up, and in 2040 it is about 27%, that more that other countries.

The proportion of the populations in Sweden and USA are almost equal, although there is considerable growht between 2000 and 2020.

For example, you shouldn't perform naked and bleeding somewhere in a tiny russian village, where there is still no culture of using and showing your body for the other reasons except for the hard-work.

Artists can't be excluded, cause putting under 'arrest' their own feelings will not give them a chance to make a real art, which always a piece of creating.

Moreover to say, having government restrictions for art means that there is a rule of autocracy, which brings all the culture under government propaganda and denies people's right of getting a full variety of information and makes people blind.

It is well accepted that an artist would never 'born' a real art being under pressure, never know what to expect.

To conclude with, I trully believe that creative artists should be able to act the way they want being free, except those cases which could harm the society or distabelise it.

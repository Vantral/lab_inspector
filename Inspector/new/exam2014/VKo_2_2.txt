Meanwhile I think it is necessary to give all the freedom to any artist, it still seems fair to me that piece of art can somehow hurt other people, so the government restrictions can be used only for protection but not for limiting one's will to express himself.

Due to the fact that contemporary art is developing and becoming more and more extraodinary, some people can say that the government should restrict such perfomance that can somehow hurt feeling of other people.

The scandalous organisation "Pussy Riot", which had punk pray in the cathedral, is still being discussed.

All the people are divided into two fighting groups; one is proclaiming that this perfomance is a form of modern art aimed to express the political protest, and another group is sure that the punk pray is nothing but only an attempt to hurt the feelings off religious people and descrinate the faith.

However, freedom of people to express their own is a constitutionally proclaimed right of everyone so no one can be deprived of it.

More to say, throughout the centuries all the artists (musicians, painters, poets) have struggled for their freedom to be heard.

Therefore, it seems to me like it is not the government who can somehow restrict the artists' freedom to express themselves.

The only rules that can somehow be excercised must be created only by the common will of society, so these rules will become some moral orientiers for artists in order to make it more easy to distinguish where the expression of themselves can hurt anyone else.

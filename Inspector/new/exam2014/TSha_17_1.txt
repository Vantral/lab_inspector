The graph presents data connected to the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA.

It can be noticed that the high level of population this age is expected to be in 2040 in all three countries.

Talking about 1940, it can be clearly seen that in all countries the quantity of people aged 65 and over was not big : 5 10%.

The difference between this criteria in Japan and other two countries is in the fact, that in Japan quantity of people aged 65 and over was decreasing to 1960, when in Sweden and USA this quantity was rising to about 1982.

In Japan the quantiny of that people was at the same level from 1960 to about 1985, after that it started to grow.

There is expected a sharp decrease from 2030 to about 2035, after that the quantity will go up slowly, reaching a peak at 27% in 2040.

It can be noticed from the graph that before 1995 the quantity of population aged 65 and over in Sweden and USA was similar with all fluctuations, but in Sweden it was less.

To sum up, in 1940 all three countries had not enormous level of people aged 65 and over, but in 2040 this quantity is expected to be really high.

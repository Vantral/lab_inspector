 To my mind, increasing number of sports facilities will not change the situation in modern society, because nowadays very often people have to tire not only to do sports, but even to sleep enough or cook dinner.

The most important is to explain them that their health depends on their own choice : to eat or not to eat junk food, to have a walk or to sit in front of the screen, watching TV, to do everything to be healthy or to do nothing.

 In conclusion, the best way to change the situation in population's health is not only to invest in new sports buildings, but to explain people how important it is to keep fit and to stay healthy and how their behavior in present will influence on their health in future, This way, I guess, it the most sensible and the most helpful.

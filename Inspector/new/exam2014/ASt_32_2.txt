There is s big discussion on whether we can develop certain traits of our character or we are cloomed to get what nature gives us at out birth.

I'm sure that we are born with certain set of features.

We grow with them and our surroundings shape them completely.

I mean that most of our characteristics are given to us by nature, but also people around us play a significant role in developing those features in us.

However, there are people who believe that they are able to alter their personality easily.

As for me, I do want to believe that we can develop some of out inherent characteristics because it makes you feel free and independent from various circumstances.

On the other hand, when I think about it I clearly understand that there is such power as genetic behavior.

If you are born to be a great musician and no one else you won't probably become a great footballer.

In conclusion, I want to say that we have to search for our talents and try out best to develop them.

We are a part of nature, that's why it influences us.

We just have to find a proper approach in order to live peacefully with out inner nature and at the same time realize as free, independent persons.

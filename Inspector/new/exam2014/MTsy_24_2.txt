Nowadays many people suppose that public health can be improved by increasing the number of sport facilities.

however, others think that it will have only a small effect on the issue and that there should be taken other measures.

To begin with, on the one hand, public health can be increased by such method, but, I think, only among the people of young age.

They have much free time and, of course, the big number of sport facilities will definitery grab their attention and make them more interested and involved in sport, and that's why their health and physical form will improve.

However, on the other hand, I don't think that public health can really be improved in such a way.

In every town there exists, at least, some sport centres, gyms, etc.

If people were interested in it, they have an opportunity to become healthier by taking up some sport.

But we can see that it is not really effective.

of course, many people do sport and they like it, but it can't improve public health.

I suppose that there should be taken some other methods to achieve this goal.

For example, the government should make medical system at all cheaper, so that everyone can visit a medical centre with any reason and get help there.

What is more, public health can be increased by making people more interested in sport, but not by big number of sport facilities.

To conclude, it is difficult to give a clearcut answer to the question whether or not public health will improve by increasing the number of sport facilities.

I thin that that goal can be achieved only by a complex system of actions of a government, but increasing the number of sport facilities will definitely influence on it in some way.

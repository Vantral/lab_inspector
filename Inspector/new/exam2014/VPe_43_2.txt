Some people think that the number of male and female taking one course should be the same, others think otherwise in my opinion, there is no place for universities to accept the equal numbers of male and female because it is not reasonable then every people hase his own preferences and it is hard to change the stable situation in universities.

It is clear that males and females sometimes have a different preferences- males are good at engeneering, physics and subjects like this and females do well in philology, teaching and so on.

The change can be a reason of situation then there is no competition in getting into the subject, if universities will accept the predicted proportion of the male and female students, some of them can take the course just because there was an vacant place and he has got a needed sex.

To sum up, from my point of view, it is not possible to universities to accept the same numbers of men and women in each course because of the humans preferences and because male and female are good at difference spots.

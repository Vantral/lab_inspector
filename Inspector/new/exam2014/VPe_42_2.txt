First of all, in our time, when students chouse university, they think about what they will study for next years.

Moreover, there are a lot of universities which give for their students perfomance of chousing subjects.

And when all students have an individual plans of study, it starts very difficult to see for numbers of male and female students in every subject.

On the other hand, there are some views of people who strongly believe that universities should control numbers of male and female students.

This people think that this reason can have affect on students.

For example, in one subject, which must study all students, there are more female students.

And male student will have bad results in the end of this subject.

However, can be that female students will have non good results in the end of the course.

Nevertheless, there are some others opinions which believe that the study process can not depend on numbers of male and female students and depends only on wants and interests of student.

In conclusion, I want to say that numbers of male and female students should not be control by universities.

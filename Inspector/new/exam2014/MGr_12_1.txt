Also we have the pie chart that indicates the way electricity is used in an average English home.

According to the graph, there was an increase in the consumption of the electricity by the evening both in winter and summer.

At the same time, in the morning time the amount of the units stood in the lowest level for all the seasons.

The chart reflects that the most of the electricity was spent for heating rooms and heating water - it was more than 50%.

While the electricity for ovens, kettles, washing machines, for living rooms and for vacuum cleaners etc was about the other half of the whole consumption of the energy.

Overall, the increas of the electricity consumption was indicated for keeping warm in rooms and heating water in both seasons.

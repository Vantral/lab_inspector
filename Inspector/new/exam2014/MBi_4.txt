The proportion of population aged 65 and over in the USA and Sweden has been increasing in both countries during the period under discussion, accounting about 9% and 7% in 1940 and 24% and 25% respectively, with the small decrease in the states between 2000 and 2020.

On the other hand, the proportion of aged people in Japan has a different inclination of changing.

In contrast to a gradual raise of the number of old people in the USA and Sweden, in Japan was a major decline of the amount of aged people during the second half of the XXth century (between 1940 and 2000), however since 2000 the number of old people aged aged 65 and over dramatically increased from 5% in 2000 and to, approximately, 26& in 2040.

Overall, despite the fact that Japan had had a dreadful downfall, it succeeded eventually, that leads to that in all three countries the amount of aged people has been increasing and reaching almost the same number in the end of the period.

According to four pie chart the one present it can be possible to make some conclusions about what are the trends of population structure in Yemen and Italy.

First of all, let's take in coliberation two charts that are related to Yemen.

As we can see, the smallest part in the structure of population is humans from 60 years old, and in both years these parts are approximently the same.

In 2000 parts of middle-aged and children of Yemen were pretty close to each other.

However, in 2050 the part of middle-aged tend to increase, while the part of children is likely to decrease to 37%.

The largest part in both years is middle-aged people, though in 2050 it is about to fall roughly.

Some people believe that universities should allow every subject for equal numbers of male and female students.

I fully disagree with this statement.

Number of people studying every subject should not be restricted because such a rule can disrupt the right of free choice for the young people.

For example, a female student will not be permitted to study one subject, because a small number of male students participates in it.

In addition, there are some subjects that are initially female (philology) or male (informatics) and it is hardly possible to await equal numbers of male and female students on these faculties.

Firthermore, each student has his own talants and abilities and he should not be obliged to study subjects, in which he is not interested.

Moreover, if university prohibit students to study definite subjects because of genders, there will be many people without high education or bad workers who work in the area, which is wrong for them.

Although there are some positive sides of male femal distribution at universities, it does not outnumber its disadvantages.

Personally, I believe that universities should not press students I their choice of future education and career.

The line graph shows the trend in usage of electricity in two different seasons in England.

It is noticable from the first graph that the units of electricity are higher in winter than in summer.

In addition to this, the winter's typical daily demand reaches its highest point at approximately 21 o'clock.

All in all, summing up the main features we may consider that people in England have a tendeney to use more electricity in the second part of the day for heating homes.

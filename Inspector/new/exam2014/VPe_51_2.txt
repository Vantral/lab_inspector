On the one hand - when in class teacher had the same proportion of both sex - it's a good posibility to work with gender differences in different areas of science - because there will be a lot of opinions from both sides.

In conclusion I would like to say that now some big and famous universities have a problem with gender stereotypes - maybe some girl wants to have military education - and for her it's impossible.

 So, to solve these problems with gender character, university should do something else exept making the numbers equal, and try a few different ways - like making a non - gender ads or organize a special help for not ordinary students.

The pie charts describe the different age groups of the population of two countries such as Yemen and Italy in 2000 and give predictions for 2050.

The structure of age groups of Italian population differs from the Yemen's one in 2000.

For example, there are only 14,3% of people, who are under 14 years old in Italy, while young people in Yemen take approximately 50%.

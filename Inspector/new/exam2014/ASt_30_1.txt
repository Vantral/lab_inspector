Secondly the table shows that Tokyo metro is much smaller and lower development than metro in London, but it takes 1927 millions passenger per year and this is because of in Tokyo population is much higher than in London .

However in the same time Washington DC metro has particularly the same size with Tokyo metro, but there are not so much passengers, Tokyo metro is really over crowded.

Koyoto metropolitan and Los Angeles don't have a lot of passengers per year, and it depends on not so very high population too.

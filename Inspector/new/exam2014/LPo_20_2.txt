First of all, we can say about different opportunities of male and female students.

I mean that if majority of male students would like to choose arts subjects, but they can't do it because they have limited number of opportunities, while other subjects remain empty.

What is more, exist such subjects which are not interesting for male students.

In conclusion I would like to say that universities should not accept equal numbers of male and female students, because students have to decide themselves which subjects they would like to study.

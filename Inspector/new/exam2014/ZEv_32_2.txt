Nowadays it can be hard to find the school where is no any students whose behaviour is far from good.

That is why administrations of schools try to make specific programs which can be successful or not in some cases.

First of all, it is difficult to mention all the reasons why schools face such problems which can sometimes lead to the bad circumstances.

One of the main problems, I suppose, is that teachers do not pay much attention to some "special students".

Furthermore, they just give them tasks, homework and that is all.

As I see, a school is a second home, so that is why teachers should be like the relatives and act in that manner.

In this case, everyone who works at school, should be very attentive and notice the changes which happen with some students, trying to know the reason of their bad behaviour or sometimes their aggressive manner.

Moreover, student behaviour is connected with the atmosphere in the family.

That is why there is should be partnership between the school and the parents to get to know what is going on with the student and help him get over all the difficulties.

It would be the main key to avoid severe problems as at school as at home too.

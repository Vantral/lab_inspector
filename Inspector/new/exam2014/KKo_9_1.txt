The given pie charts provide the information on the percentage of differently aged people in Yemen and Italy for 2000 and the prediction of how this percentage will change in 2050.

First, let's take a look at the ages of population of both countries in 2000.

Almost a half of Yemens population is taken over by the children from 0 to 14 years, while this age group in Italy covers only 14%.

The other half of Yemens population consists of 46% of adults and only 4% of elderly people.

However, in Italy adults present the biggest part in population - almost 62%.

And the elder part is not small too.

Then, looking at 2050 pie charts for both countries, we can see that the elder population in Yemen will not increase much, while in Italy there will be almost twice more elders.

The number of people aged 0 14 years in Yemen will considerably decrease, leaving place for adult population, which will grow up by 11%.

To sum up, we can clearly see that Yemen has tendency to have more young population, while Italy has more representatives of elder age groups.

And in 50 years the ages of population of both countries will change consequently.

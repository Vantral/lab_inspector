So, it is obvious that universities can not accept the equal number of boys and girls in some technical subjects.

Also, not many boys are interested in Arts, Literature or Design, that is why it is impossible to have equal proportion of people of both genders in these subjects.

For example, universities can not accept girls to study some specific kinds of surgery as very hard equipment is used there.

On the other hand, it could be said that in the 21st century there should not be differentiation between genders and universities should accept equal proportion of boys and girls for each subject.

All in all, I strongly believe that it is not possible to have 50 :50 proportion of men and women in all kinds of universities.

The most important thing for universities to have students that have appropriate skills in a subject and are interested in it whichever gender these students are.

The rest of population were mostly the middle-aged adults from 15 to 59 : 46,3% the oldest group of population aged over 60 took only 3,6% of the whole.

However, a different picture is forecast for the year 2050 : the largest group of population - the kids aged under 14 - will probably reduce in comparison with year 2000 while the other groups will probably both increase up to 57,3% and 5,7% correspondingly.

The demographical situation in Italy is different from Yemen : in 2000 over a half of population consisted of the middle-aged.

In 2050 the part of middle-aged adults will reduce as well as the kids part giving place to the oldest which will almost double.

It can be seen from the chart that only smal minority of women choose skilled vocational diploma qualifications.

Talking about males, I can mention that practically three quarters of them choose to take postgraduate diploma but only 35 37% decide to stop on undergraduate diploma.

It also can be mentioned that bachelor's level qualifications are taken both by females and males practically in same proportions.

Taking everything into account I may say that males tend to take more advanced levels of educational qualifications (postgraduate diploma, master's degree), but women more often stop on Undergraduate diploma (in more advanced levels number of females is decreasing and shows us a strong downward trend).

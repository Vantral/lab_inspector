We can see that the London Underground was opened in 1863 and the system is the oldest one.

By the way, it also has the longest route, which is 394 million kilometres.

Talking about the amount of passengers per year I can say that it is not too big, in comparison with the amount in Tokyo.

Talking about railway systems which were built in 1900 in Paris, I can say that the route length is a half from London's metro.

It is important to mention that underground in Tokyo has the biggest amount passengers per year, though it was built 64 years after the first underground given in the table.

We can see that the shorted route is in Koyoto, the length is just 11 kilometres and the amount of passengers is also the smallest there - just 45 millions per year.

I can also mention, that the underground system of Los Angeles, which is the youngest (it was opened just in 2002 ) is quite longer than Koyoto's system and has 28 kilometres of route, and the amount of passengers per year is 5 millions bigger.

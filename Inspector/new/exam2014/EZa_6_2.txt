We wouldn't be untrue if we would say that almost all modern culture is based on the idea that it should make people happy.

But the main thing is that nobody exactly knows what does it mean "to be happy".

We can say that happiness is very personal feeling which cannot be put in words.

Sometimes there are all circumstances for a person for being happy, but he feels nothing.

But At the same time there could be a man, who had almost nothing : no work, no money, no health, no family, but he would think that he's the happiest in the world.

Happiness is the concept which just goes out of an rationality so that's why we cannot put the feeling of being happy in words.

And we face more difficulties when we try not even to define happiness but to show "ingridients" of that feeling.

We've already shown that happiness is more than just wealth or health because otherwise some Europe countries would lead, not poor and ill african failed stales.

So all we can suggest is that happiness is linked with some state of soul, some piece between man and himself.
<So AV0><all DT0><we PNP><can VM0><suggest VVI><is VBZ><that CJT><happiness NN1><is VBZ><linked VVN><with PRP><some DT0><state NN1><of PRF><soul NN1><, PUN><some DT0><piece NN1><between PRP><man NN1><and CJC><himself PNX><. SENT>@
Modern world destroys that piece, put a person into constant conflicts, for example we have to make money by making thinks he doesn't like or something in that way.

And he tries to find the lost piece of himself in the modern industries built to make people happy.

He goes into traveling or clubs or aquaparks or expend sports but that is the wrong way.

The happiness is the state of mind which cannot be brought to a man by anything except man himself.

So it seems to be impossible to find any common factors or find a recept, suitable for every situation.

It is obvious that increasing the number of sports available will definetely help to some local areas, whereas the metropolitan areas will still be untouched because people are too busy there and the only way to improve their health is changing their lifestyles.

The problem is, that people nowadays are suffering from enormous fall in the level of carbon dioxide and simple sports cannot prevent harmful impact on people`s health.

Taking everything into consideration, I must say, that increasing the number of sport facilities may have a positive impact on the problem, but there are a better ways such as proper behaviour which have a lot more advantages.

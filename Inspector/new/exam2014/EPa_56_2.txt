It is argued that sport is a major way to improve social health.

To my mind, even if sport actually makes us healthier we can not leave population with that single measure.

To support the idea of wider range of improvements, we need to take into account the general socio-economic situation in the world.

To this extent not only people but also governments need to manage the situation and put industries under a strict control.

Moreover, we can not skip the fact that smoking became a number-one problem for citizens.

The issue is that more people take up smoking while few people cope with giving it up.

That is why those who are not addicted to cigarettes are endangered to get harm from second-hand smoking.

So, my opinion is that governments also need to do everything to reduce smoking population to increase health.

The best way to achieve this goal is to combine this way with other aspects of governmental and individual care.

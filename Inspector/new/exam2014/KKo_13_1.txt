The bar graphs illustrates changes in the amount of minutes on telephone calls, including local-fixed line, national and international and mobiles lines in the UK from 1995 to 2002 years.

According to this bar graph the number of minutes of local phones each year from 1995 to 1999 went up, hitting a peak in 1999, about 90 billions of minute, but the next three years the number of minutes is declined rapidly.

In contrast, over the same period the use of national and international lines was less twice than local lines.

As we can see, during the whole period has been dramatically increase of using mobile phones from nearly 4 billion in 1995 to more than 45 billion in 2002.

In addition, I'd like to say that between 1995 and 1999 the most popular phone calls in the UK was local calls.

But interestengly, that the mobile calls dramaticly increase.

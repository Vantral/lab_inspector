Secondly, it is easier to develop sport, than to spend money on other measures, because lots of people can use a few facilities, On the contrary, if you want to improve medicine, you need to invent new ways how to treat people and only then use them, So it takes a lot of time.

On the other hand, some people are sure that sport is not the most appropriate way if you want to make people healthier.

They explain their position with the fact that there is a part of society, who does not love sport, and it does not matter for them, if you increase the number of facilities or not.

In this case, it is more likely to use more popular methods, which will have an influence on all people and will help to improve public health.

In conclusion, I would like to say that it is better to use differents measures at once, and then the results will be more evident and productive.

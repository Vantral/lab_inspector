There is the opinion that in Univercities should learn the same count of boys and girls.

The first and the main point to opposite the preview statement is that biologically for different sex consuitable different kinds of work.

While girls enter the phylosophy, psyhology or sociology faculties, boys prefer machine and technical specializations.

Girls are interested in arts, music and literature and boys are crazy about computers and other technical things which are often difficult for understanding for so many women.

The second point to opposite this is that to get the same number of different sex student is not rational and impossible just because of different proportion of male and female in every city.

By this way there will be less students in universities and less educated people in country that can't be an advantage.

But from the other side, I can guess that this kind of universities' accepting students can be really pleasure.

On the directing faculty, for example, people can exchange their experience and see some situations as for women side, as for man.

In conlution I want to say that practice of the same proportion of accepting male and female students has more disadvantages than advantages because of many features and preferences of these both sex.

But sometimes it can be really helpful in work to have the same number of male and female people because of opportunity to experiences exchange.

This graph gives us information about percentage of population older 65 years from 1940 to 2040 in 3 countries such as Japan, Sweden and USA.

Firstly, the percentage of population in all of the observed countries will increase significantly to the period of the 2040-s.

For example, in Japan which will leave the highest proportion of people aged 65 and more 27%, this amount will rise on almost 22% in the comparison with 1940.

As for another two countries, both of them will leave steady increase in 2030 - by almost 5 percent.

Nevertheless, we can observe some decreases between 1980 and 1990 in Sweden and USA.

Whereas, in Japan it was period of steadiness during to almost 25 years (1960 1985) after dropping from 5 to 3 percent.

In conclusion, I would like to say that all in all this graph indicates rather positive trend in increasing population aged 65 and older.

Moreover, some people claim that a gap year is a waste of time which students rather spend on mastering their course, developing skills and other practical things, which are relevant for their future.

What's more, the situation in the educational system and career market is constantly changing, so students may miss or lose an opportunity to enter a good university with a prospective of a well-paid job if they take such a long break.

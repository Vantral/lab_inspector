On the one hand, increasing the number of sport facilities is a good way to encourage people to keep healthy.

The bigger amount of these facilities can allow more people to go in a sport club.

Furthermore, though openning new sports facilities, people can learn a new kind of activity, so it is a great way of improving and broadminding the population.

On the other hand, this improvement may not bring the expected results.

To start with, the majority does not have much time to do any kind of sport.

People nowadays are very busy with work and the increase in the amount of facilities can not make their leisure time become much.

For many people it is more interesting to pay computer games or watch TV, for instance, than do any sport.

Finally, the increase in the amount of sport centers has little effect on the data of public health.

For example, sport can not deal with serious deseases and illnesses.

Nevertheless, in my opinion, the increasing of sport facilities, in any case, will have a positive effect.

We can see three parametres : date of opening, kilometres of route and passangers per one year (in millions people).

The oldest underground railway system is in London, it was opened in IXX century, in 1863.

What about the newest underground railway system from our six cities, it is located in Los Angeles and was opened in XXI century, in 2001.

Other Underground railway system I want to write in order of date opened : Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC and Kyoto URS, so they were opened in 1900.

Now about kilometres of route.

The smallest and shortest URS is situated in Kyoto, Japan with nearly 11 kilometres of route.

The biggest number of passangers per year is in Tokyo with 1927 millions people per year.

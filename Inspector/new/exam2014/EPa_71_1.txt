As we can see the marketable trend that all population of Yemen consists in the whole of such groups of population as children to 14 years and 15 59 year-people.

But in Italy there is another situation in 2000.

 The percentage of children to 14 years is much smaller than in Yemen in the same year and it is only 14,3 points.

In projections of the population of Italy there is an overall trand for declining of medium-aged group by near the 15 percents.

In conclusion, we can see that the medium-aged population in Yemen will increase in 2050, although the elder people will be at the same level.

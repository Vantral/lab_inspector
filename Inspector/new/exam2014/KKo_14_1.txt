The chart shows the total number of minutes of local, national and international and mobiles calls over the period of seven years from 1995 to 2002.

It can be seen that the number of minutes of local calls remained greater from the number of other calls over all the period.

The number of minutes of mobile calls started of the smallest level of approximately 3 billions, then it stadily went up to about a 10 billions in 1999.

After it sharply rose to 15 billions in 2002 what means it became nearly to the number of minutes of national and international calls.

To summarise, the number of minutes of local calls fluctuated during this period and went to a started value.

It is more important to invest money into ecological programms such as providing factories with special filters, planting trees, production natural products and other envoronmental programms.

In conclusion, I want to say that the problem of public health is extremely important nowadays and we should spend more money is projects which will solve the reasons of such problem, such as poor ecology and we are not able to waste money on sport, which only helps to make our health better, but doesn`t deal with the reasons of this problem - bad ecology.

In accordance with the american research , the the process of studing of people from mixed gender and cultural groups is rather more effective because it helps to invent more ideas and provides a kind of cultural and gender dialog between students.

On the other hand, the University competition must be fair and, if there are more succesful male candidates then female, it can't be considered as a gender discrimination.

To sum it up, the equal number of students of both genders makes the studing process more interesting and effective, but inspite of this fact the competition must be just fair.

The pie charts below illustrates data on the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and give some expectations on future situation in 2050.

At the first glance, it is clear that in every country except Yemen in 2000 the majority of population consists of people from 15 to 59 years.

Particularly, percentage of generation aged from 15 to 59 is predicted to grow by just above 10 percent, whereas it is expected that the share of children not older 14 years dramatically reduce from about 50 percent to 37.

Simultaneously, there will be reduction of middle-eged population, while percentage of older people remain, presumably, on the same level.

Some of them require men, for example, the majority of pilots are male, while most of teachers are female, consecuently there is no need in accepting equal number of students in every subject, because it does not collerates with labour required.

And the last but definitely not least idea that need to be pointed out is the following : it is difficult for Universities to accept equal number of students because this process is too complicated and takes place in a very short period of time.

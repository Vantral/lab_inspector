There are people who think that creative artists like writers, film makers and others shold be given the absolute freedom to express their views and ideas and there should be no government restrictions on what they do.

I agree that there should be no government restrictions but to my mind there should be ethical restrictions for creative artists.

Firstly, government should not limit artists because the restrictions may be connected with the regime of the country.

For example, in times of the Russian Empire many books of great writers were not allowed by the government because they expressed revolutionary points of views.

Many amazing ideas of modern artists are not expressed because of government and that is why I believe that the art should be protected from government.

There is no criteria for art and I suppose that it is very difficult to find it.

On the other hand, there should be some limits for creative artists.

For example, one of the famous photographers of the XX century, Mary Brook-White, took pictures of cut heads of the revolutioners in the Arabic countries.

There are many argues about theese photos because on the one hand people must know the truth about government in the Arabic countries but, on the other hand, theese photos are not ethic.

The diagram presents the percentage of the population aged 65 and over in three countries such as Japan, Sweden and the USA from 1940 to 2040.

According to graph, the proportion of Japan population remained fairly steady from 1940 to 2040, but then it became to increase significantly and reached a peak in 2040.

The proportion of the USA population had a gradual growth during one hundred years, whereas Sweden had wide fluctuations.

The percentage in 1940 was about 7%, then it increased gradually but after 1980 became to fluctuate and was 25% in 2040.

Thus, the proportion of population aged 65 and over in all countries had different changes, but the basic trend was upward.

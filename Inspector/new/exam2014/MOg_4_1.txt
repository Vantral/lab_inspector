The most interesting fact is that the maximum and the minimum of passengers are in Japan in two capitals - Tokyo (max) and Kyoto (min).

Moreover Kyoto's underground railway system has the smallest length and it stands at 11 kilometres.

The longest metro is in London (the length is almost 400 kilometres) and it is the oldest one - it was opened in 1863.

The railway systems in Paris and Washington DC are considerably close in length (199 km and 126 km), but as for passengers per year the difference is significant - nearly 1000 millions per year.

If we will try to estimate the number of passengers we will notice that on the top will be situated Tokyo, Paris, London, than with the great difference Washington DC, and than almost three times as less as in Washington for Kyoto and Los Angeles.

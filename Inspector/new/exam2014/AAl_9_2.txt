For example, man are interested in hunting or cars' repairing and women are interested in cooking and teaching, So, the establishing such equalities in universities will not give an opportunity to a huge amount of people to do the things they want to do.

In conclusion, to my mind making such equality will be a wrongful decision because there is no matter whether you are male of female , a university should educate you withough such separation.

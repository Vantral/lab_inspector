I believe, that charity activity and helping and teaching to youngers can teach olders what it feels to be kind for others, can show us what we can better than we already are, and also what we can make our world better and much more beautifull together.

It's really awesome I think, so if this initiative used properly it defenitely should be a compulsory part of high school programmes.

Some of students in high schools just can't spend extra time helping the youngers in reason of hard exam preparation.

They should study hard if they want to gain good marks on exam and go to the university which they choosed.

So if charity activity become "must to do" they have great chance to lose marks on the exam.

So, in my opinion, this initiative can be one of the best ideas for our high school, but just if used properly and didn't make students lose their marks.

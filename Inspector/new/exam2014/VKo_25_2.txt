Nowadays, at the age of modern technologies it could be too hard to find a person, who is not interested in the modern and creative arts.

We also know that the works of creative artists are sometimes rather provocative and controvertial.

There is an important argue between those, who believe that artists should be governmentally restricted in their ideas and others, who think they should be given the freedom to creative.

In my point of view, poets, actors and other creative people can have an opportunity to pronounce their ideas and show them in the works of art.

Firstly, according to the constitution, all people can express their own opinion in the way they like (this is also about the creative people).

Secondly, if the government control the arts, it would be really boring to look on the works of art (from pictures of films) because of the equality of them.

Some people believe that creative people are an example for the young generation and they should educate them.

That is why they must show happiness, love and kindness in their works of art.

I cannot really agree with this point of view because I strongly believe that the young generation should know all the sides of our life, not only good ones.

In conclusion, I would like to add that such parts of our live as films, music, pictures must be out of the government controll because all people need to express their feelings and thoughts freely and works of art are spectacular way of it.

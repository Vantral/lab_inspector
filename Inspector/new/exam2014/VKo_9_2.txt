Nowadays the question of self-expression is being widely discussed, because of spreading the government restrictions on it in Russia.

To my mind, there should not be official restrictions from our government, but there should be inner moral rules about what somebody can or cannot do.

Firstly, I have to say that nobody can stop our imagination creating different ideas, and government restrictions will not make us do it.

They can only make some types of arts illegal, but it does not mean that these types of arts will die out.

But I should notice that some types of arts cannot be shown to the children, because it may hurt their feelings or minds or be really unacceptable for this little age.

Besides, I believe that expressing and watching are different things, that we cannot combine in our discussion.

I guess that everybody has a right to express what he thinks or feels, but everytime a person should remember that he can upset his relatives or friends.

To sum it all up I want to say that everybody has to dicide for himself if he can express something, which is inside of him, or cannot.

For me, it is more important to have inner restrictions than have useless government rules which try to control our modern art.

First of all, to make equal numbers of boys and girls at university is impossible.

Secondly, I'm sure that there is not a big necessity to accept equal proportion because it is not important how many male and female students will be, more serious how.

Equal proporion of girls and boys will show equal right of all genders.

In conclusion, I'd like to say that, of course, maybe equal numbers of male and female students will help to avoid some different conflicts, but I'm sure that it's not important how many boys and girls, it is more important that they have a great desire for studying and be friendly with each other.

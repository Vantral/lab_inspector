They are convinced that all these things have no huge influence on people`s health and other methods are required.

May be they think not about facilities, but about improving the conditions of their life like doing something to prevent air pollution and enviroment damage.

In this case, I think, both of ways of improving health are possible, so they can exist together that is way peopl with second point of view should not be agains the first.

In conclusion I would like to say that to my mind there is a really good situation with sport in lot of countries and if people want to do something for their health they should not blame their government and say that it is not enough methods and facilities.

While the proportions of elderly people from USA and Sweden was almost always increasing, the one of Japan had a long periods of a gentle fall from 1940 up to 4 percent and of stagnation from 1960 to nearly 1990.

During this time (1940 - 1990) USA and Sweden had similar changes in elderly population that means a gradual rise up to the point 15 percent.

Beginning from 2000 the situation changes dramatically and while Sweden's population aged 65 grew rapidly till 2010, USA's one remained stable.

To sum up, althoug the proportion of the population aged 65 stayed the lowest one, compared to other countries, in Japan for a long time, after 2030 it started to rise and finally became a leader with its percentage number of nearly 28.

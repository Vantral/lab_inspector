Here we may see the graph which presents us the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1 thousand years n Japan, Sweden and USA.

So we may see that sharp line which "belongs" to USA is the most steady.

The line of Japan shows us that from 1940 to 2030 the proportion of population in this country have changed not so much, but then shockly increases.

To sum up, we may say that Sweden may be called the most progressive in this case.

So we may notice that all of the lines go up, it means that proportion of population aged 65 and over within years years will be higher and higher.

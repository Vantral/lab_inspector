Some people argue that creative artists are given too much freedom nowadays, while others think that self-expression can't be limited with any kinds of rules.

However, these pieces of art can be harmful for children, because they are very sensitive and they percept everything they see.

That's why the adults shouldn't not be restricted from getting acquomted with this or that piece of art.

The restrictions are to focus on protection of children and dignity of other people and not on some political matters.

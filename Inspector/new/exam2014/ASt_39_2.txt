In general, it is clear that characteristic we are born with is a foundation of our future development, in this way, initial qualities define your personal development way.

On the other hand, physical initial characteristics may also affect on future development and even perform completely.

To conclude, I strongly believe that mental initial characteristics we are born with have the major influence as physical gaps are not a problem today

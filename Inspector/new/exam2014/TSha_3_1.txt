Proportion of population aged 65 and over was almost equal - in Sweden and the USA from 1940 to 1990, however, while the USA line remained steady untill 2015 and then started to grow rapidly, the Sweden line was fluctuating.

In contrast, the amount of adult population in Japan started to increase after a small decline from 1940 to 1960 and then rocketed in 2025 2035, crossing both Sweden and the USA lines.

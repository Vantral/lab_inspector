The following graph provides a brief overview on the proportion of the population aged 65 and over on a time period between 1940 and 2040 in Japan, Sweden and the USA.

Following the time line it can be said that in the 1940 till 1950-es the differences between all three countries were quite irrelevant .

However, with nearly 10% the USA was dominating Sweden in one and a half and Japan nearly twice times.

Till the early 2000-es the situation was stable with a constant grow of the valued age group, whereas later Sweden shows a radical jump to over 20% rate.

By the 2030 the tendency in all the three countries will be alike with the proportion reaching 20% and further 25% by the 2040 as predicted .

The most rapid growth will be shown by Japan , which in recent years kept below 5% rate proportion and by the 2040 stay in the same line with the rest countries a bit dominating them.

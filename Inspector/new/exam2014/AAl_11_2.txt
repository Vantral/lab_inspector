I think, proportional system of students can helps to understand for person both strategies of thinking , look at the same problem in different ways.

For my own experience I can make comparison that choising proportional system in education is really very important part.

For example : in my school I educated in the class of girls.

Nowadays, it is not secret that girls become better in some ways of life than boys.

For example, girls move attentivly than boys, they ready for help in higher way.

Also it is reason for self-developing.

In conclusion , I would like to say that universities make right choise , when accept equal number of male and female in every subject , but it is not availible now, case of the general population of male and female is not the same.

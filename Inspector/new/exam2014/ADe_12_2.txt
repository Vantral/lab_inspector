On the one hand, if a child starts to learn foreign language in primary school, he can become an expert in this language in the future.

Nevertheless, a child, who enters the primary school, has no idea about the number of subjects he will have to study.

To conclude, there were presented both points of view about the advantages and disadvantages of learning foreign languages at primary school.

Speaking about initial trends in population in Italy and Yemen in 2000 it should be noticed that the main difference could be seen in numbers of people aged 60+ years which are 20% more presented in Italy.

Another interesting comparison that should be highlighted is that half of Yemen population consists of citizens aged between 0 and 14 years while in Italy they take only 15%.

Summing it up, all the data presented predicts better future by the year 2050 for Yemen where the most hard-working part of population (aged 15 59 years) will take almost 60%.

To 2040 the highest number of the population aged 65 and over is presumed to be in Japan, though before it had the lowest position on the graph and indicators were even descending.

In contrast, from1940 to 2040 such type of population was rising in Sweden and USA without almost any stop.

It is noticable that approximately in 2028 in Japan there is a large jump supposed, so the proportion would probably arise to circa 27% of inhabitants.

Overall, after analyzing the information given, we could notice that the foreheaded jump of the percentage of old inhabitants in Japan grounds the proposal that some extra cure will be invented there in the next 15 years.

However, until this moment the population of Japan will suffer, because of early deaths of granmothers and grandfathers.

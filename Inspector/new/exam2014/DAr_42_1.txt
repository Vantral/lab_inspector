It is projected that in 2050 in Yemen, this percentage will increase slightly will 57,3, despite the predicting that the same percentage will fall in Italy by 17 percent.

As for old population, which was initially only 3,6 percent in 2010 in Yemen, it is expected to rise a little bit for 2,1 percent by 2050.

According to predictions, the percent of people over 60 is going to go up in Italy too, but in contrast this percentage is much higher that in Yemen and will increase considerable from 24,1 to 42,3 percent.

What is more, the rate of children from 0 to 14 years old will fall in 2050 by 13 percent to 37 points, initially reaching exactly half of Yemen population.

However, the figure of young population in Italy is going to remain almost constant, going up from 14,3 points for only 3 percent.

Finally, there is a trend that population will became older in 2050 in both counries, although in Yemen will be more people of middle age than it was in 2010.

and the only way to solve this problem is to restrict the artists actions in there works by the government to introduce censorship.

Talking all this into cansideration, I must say that my oppinion is that, despite the fact that it may offend the artists and some of other people, there should be some government restrictions in artists actions as some things should not be shown on publics.

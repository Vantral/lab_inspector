The pie charts shows the shaves of the populations of the different ages in Yemen and Italy and also gives projections of changing in figures in 2050.

 To start with, one of the most significant trend was that shave of people, who aged 0 14 years, was about a half of the whole population in Yemen in 2000, while in Italy it was approximately 14,3%.

As a matter of fact, in 2000 in Italy the percentage of such kind of population was more than 61%, whereas in Yemen, the fugure was about 46,3%.

Compared to Yemen, where the percentage of older people was represented at the highly low level, in Italy share was about 24%.

 Projections shows the sharp rise in quantity of people aged 15 59 years and the decrease in numbers of older people, in fact the figures are 57,3% and 37%.

 The population of Italy is expected to follow different trend, as the percentage of people aged 15 59 years will fall, while there will probably be an increase in the number of older people.

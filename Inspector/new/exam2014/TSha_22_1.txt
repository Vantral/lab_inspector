Obviously, we might point out that proportions all over the countries flactuate during 100 years (from 1940 to 2040).

We notice that there is a gradual growth in persantage of people elder 65 in Japan and Sweden while the USA tendency is quite stable from the year 1940 to 2020 and there is a huge bust in the year 2030 when the proportion reaches the point of 25% after 10% which was in the previous year.

The most attrective predictance is seen in the USA future, because their proportion is the biggest and it reaches a pick in the 2040 at the point of 27 persents.

At the same time the maximum of Sweden's proportion is 25,5 persents and Japan's maximum is 23,5 persents.

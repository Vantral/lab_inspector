 Overall, it is predicted that population of both Jemen and Italy will become elder in 2050 than in 2000.

According to the graphs, illustrating the year 2000, in Yemen people who are 0 14 years old, prevail, whereas in Italy people comaratively older and the prevailinge age is 15 59.

 Moreover, the amount of middle-aged population in Yemen is not significantly lower than the number of youngsters.

On the other hand, the amount of them is the lowest in Italy, whereas people, who are 60+ years old are on the 2nd place according to their part in general population.

 As it can be seen from the graph illustrating the situation in 2050.

The amount of 15 59 and 60+ years old will increase, whereas the amount of 0 14 year old will decline.

At the same time in Italy the number of 60+ years old is predicted to rise practically twice and amount of young and middle-aged population will decrease.

The result of these changes is that the prevailing age group both in Yemen and Italy will become 15 59 years.

Many people are triing to solve that, and to make proper decisions there is a need to work out the key factors causing the behaviour change.

As far as I'm concerned, one of the main reasons of bad behaviour is a nurture.

One of the important causes is also the character of a person.

That is why some people behave badly thinking such a way will help him to look older or cleverer even though this is not always work.

Personally, I also believe that some teachers might be the cause of the bad behaviour of students.

Those teachers who have strong character, who are strict and loyal at the same time will never face negative attitude from their students.

First of all, I believe it is important to talk with students who behave in a bad way.

Ultimately, I suppose that bad behaviour will also survive in the society.

I believe that it have to be solved with every student privately, and primarily in a form of the dialogue.

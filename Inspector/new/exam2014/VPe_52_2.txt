And, finally, education shouldn't be the instrument of our government, I mean our authorities shouldn't solve gender problem through the equal number of male and female students in the class.

By the way, some Scandinavian countries have such an experience , because their authorities take care about gender aspects and their policies are aimed at the warning of discrimination of any kind.

In my opinion, Russians and Scandinavians are as different as chalk and cheese so that it's impossible to accept their experience in our country.

 Of course our gender policy in Russia leaves much to be desired so that such measures as accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject will not survive the situation.

To sum it up, I'd love to add that tastes differ and students choose subjects on the base of their interests but not because they should be included of the list of members.

I do support the idea that we should fight with discrimination but our problems so deep, that such measures as we are suggested, aren't suitable for our situation.

So, our government should start worry about the gender situation in the country and take some right steps to make the situation better.

According to the pie chart, the majority of electricity is used for heating rooms and water and it takes more than 50% from all amount.

These two charts understand each other, because the first describes the main tendencies for two seasons and the second illustrates this demand.

Overall, the using of electricity is very important and the necessarity of it rises by winter not only at the evenings, but the whole day.

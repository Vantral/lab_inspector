In spite of the fact that the percentage of old people in USA and Sweden increased from 1940 to 1980, this proportion in Japan declined from 5 to 3 percents.

In conclusion, we can claim that in 2040 the percentage of old people will be bigger than today and Japan will have an older population than USA and Sweden.

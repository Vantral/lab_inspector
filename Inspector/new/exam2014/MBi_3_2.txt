The information provided illustrates a quantaty of aged people in the period between 1940 and 2040 in three countries : Japan, Sweden and USA.

It can be deduced from the graph that the minimal quantaty of aged people can be noticed in Japan.

The development of proportions in this country is not stable because there was a decline in proportions of the population aged 65 and over during the period from 1940 to 1960, then the indicators were stable, and after about 1990 there is a dramatical rising that will be saved till 2040.

In contrast, USA showed the highest results during the period between 1940 and 1990, demonstrating a stable growth from aproximately 9% in 1940 to about 14% in 1990.

Similarly, in Sweden it can be noticed a big quantaty of aged people during the monthned period.

The proportion of population aged 65 and over increased from about 7% in 1940 to aproximately 17% in 1990.

However, after 1990 Sweden became one of most "aged country", demonstrating a dramatical growth, whlen will also planned in the future years.

Overall, after analyzing the information provided it can be said that the development of proportion of the aged people is not stable, because the leader of the statistics in the early years can become the country with the minimized quantaty of aged people and Japan can become the most aged country in 2040.

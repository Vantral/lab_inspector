Generally speaking, the largest proportion of Internet users was among urban and suburban households.

The number of the group reached a peak of nearly 55% in 2004.

At the same time the percentage of rural households was soaring from 2% in 1999 to just 35% in selected 2004.

If we compare both groups, it can be seen that during the period the proportion of country-side users of Internet grew dramatically, while urban and suburban users seemed to stop a rapid growth in 2002.

Moreover, rural households increased the total percentage from 2% to 35%, while urban users soar the number by almost 40%.

It is evident that access of Internet in selected period rocketed more rapidly in rural areas, but the overall proportion was the highest among city and town citizens.

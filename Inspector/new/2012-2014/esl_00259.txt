2 'Homonymy and polysemy; lexical and grammatical ambiguity' by John Lyons deals with an important problem of contemporary semantics, namely, the difference between  homonymy and polysemy.

In particular, I would like to comment on the following issues : (1) partial homonymy; (2) grammatical homonymy; (3) the criteria of polysemy.

John Lyons defines homonyms as different lexemes with at least one identical form.
<John NP0><Lyons NP0><defines VVZ><homonyms NN2><as PRP><different AJ0><lexemes NN2><with PRP><at PRP><least AV0><one CRD><identical AJ0><form NN1><. SENT>@
The author maintains that this is a basic condition but it should be combined with others : 1) unrelated in meaning; 2) all their forms are identical; 3) the identical forms are grammatically equivalent.
<The AT0><author NN1><maintains VVZ><that CJT><this DT0><is VBZ><a AT0><basic AJ0><condition NN1><but CJC><it PNP><should VM0><be VBI><combined VVN><with PRP><others NN2><: PUN><1 CRD><) PUR><unrelated AJ0><in PRP><meaning NN1><; PUN><2 CRD><) PUR><all DT0><their DPS><forms NN2><are VBB><identical AJ0><; PUN><3 CRD><) PUR><the AT0><identical AJ0><forms NN2><are VBB><grammatically AV0><equivalent AJ0><.

If the lexemes satisfy all of the conditions, Lyons calls them 'absolute homonyms'.
<If CJS><the AT0><lexemes NN2><satisfy VVB><all DT0><of PRF><the AT0><conditions NN2><, PUN><Lyons NP0><calls VVZ><them PNP><' POS><absolute AJ0><homonyms NN2><' POS><. SENT>@
 If lexemes satisfy one or two of the conditions, they are called 'partial homonyms'.

I propose to divide partial homonyms into 2 groups depending on whether they satisfy third term or not.

Therefore, there are at least two combinations : first and third terms (e.

Division of different parts of speech would simplify Lyons' classification and make all issues of homonymy clear.

  Most scholars continue division distinguishing between homonymy of lexemes with identical form(s) and homonymy of morphemes.

Lyons presents general information about lexical homonymy but the author does not mention morphological homonymy which is significant to nouns in languages with cases.

For example, three of six forms of russian words of third declension have the same ending -Ð¸ (e.

The word in every case has its own meaning and so it is impossible to treat them in the same way.

Moreover, division of them is essential for machine translation and for students who learn foreign language which has homonymy.

 After that Lyons distinguishes polysemy and homonymy.

It has a significant impact on dictionaries which recognize the distinction between polysemy and homonymy.

There is a single dictionary entry for a polysemous item and two or more separate entries for homophonous lexemes.

 Lyons describes two criteria which distinguish between homonymy and polysemy.
<Lyons NP0><describes VVZ><two CRD><criteria NN2><which DTQ><distinguish VVB><between PRP><homonymy NN1><and CJC><polysemy NN1><. SENT>@
The first one is etymology and the second is relatedness.
<The AT0><first ORD><one PNI><is VBZ><etymology NN1><and CJC><the AT0><second ORD><is VBZ><relatedness NN1><. SENT>@
If words have one origin and they are close in meaning, Lyons consider this event as polysemy and vice-versa.

However, there are some debatable cases when one more criterion is needed.

The form pupil, for example, has two different meanings, 'school child' and 'part of the eye'.

The words have one origin but nowadays they are semantically unrelated.

Therefore, it is quite difficult to refer the case to polysemy or homonymy relaying on only two criteria.

The verb 'ask' is another sample of disadvantage of using two criteria.

It has one origin and at least two different meanings discovered by testing the context (e.

In these cases scholars look at the correspondences in languages related to English and find whether two meanings correlate with one verb.

This criterion is called regularity.

It is more objective than intuition of the native speaker about relatedness of meaning so it should be used likewise.

Then there are at least three criteria for distinction between homonymy and polysemy and one addition to the test of relatedness of meaning (analyze of context).

  To conclude, the study has a significant impact on machine translation, dictionaries and teaching foreign students.

However, different ways of testing polysemy and homonymy have been used so an addition with the aim to answer requirements for today's linguistics should be made.

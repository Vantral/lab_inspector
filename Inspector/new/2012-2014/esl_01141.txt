"The Road less travelled" is divided in four parts : Discipline, Love, Growth and Religion, and Grace.

In the first section, named Discipline, Scott is talking about how to solve problems.

This means that the main thing we should understand in life is that suffering is normal.

The main thing that prevents us from spiritual growth, which - according to Peck - is the main goal of human life, is the fear of suffering.

We can see it when we are afraid of responsibilities, of problem solving, of saying truth, etc.

The main idea of this part is that to overcome this fear one should be extremely disciplined, there is no other way.

Dr Peck asserts that depression or different crises is the result of "reloading the outdated map" and is just normal critical stages of development, after which we can, in a sense, be reborn.

This motive according to Dr Peck is love.

Dr Peck believes that love is "the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth".

That means that love takes time and serious work, and cannot be easy and romantic as it is so often portrayed in films and books.

What also seems important to Scott in human life is "a gradual but progressive enlargement of the self, an incorporation within of the world without, and a growth, a stretching and thinning of our ego boundaries.

In this way the more and longer we extend ourselves, the more we love, the more blurred becomes the distinction between the self and the world.

We become identified with the world.

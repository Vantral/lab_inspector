The given graph and the chart demonstrate some alteration in extinctions of plant and animal species of tropical forests per decade and some influence of human impact and natural events on threats to plant life.

As we can see on the graph, the strongest extinction of plants and animals refers to 2060, and the lowest to the 2000.

This inform us, that dying out of living being of tropical forest is increasing all the time from now till 2060, but then, from 2060 the extinction will be decreasing.

On the second picture, the chart shows as that the human impact has the biggest influence on threats to plant life (it is about 81,3%), than the natural events (which is 18,7% in all).

The powerful force of humans on the threats has the agriculture and the lesser has the plantation.

Also the natural events have the biggest influence with the threats to plant by various natural disasters.

As a conclusion, we can see that the human impact significantly affects to extinction of animal and plant species in tropical forests and to threats to plant fife.

All that need be said is that the story never goes where you expect it too and the final twists â while seeming a bit outlandish at first â ultimately make a great deal of somewhat sickening sense.

 Fight Club is the story of an unnamed narrator, an insomniac yuppie who spends his days helping insurance companies get out of having to pay their claims.

Fight Club really captures the very male desire for destruction and chaos.

I guess the book comes off as being pretty pessimistic, and maybe that's one downside to it.

And I just thought it did a great job capturing that feeling that we all have--that restlessness when we feel like life is just the same day after day.

 Of course you can't help but compare the book to the movie.

And in saying that I was surprised to learn that Fight Club the movie followed the book faithfully (including dialogue).

It is so similar in fact that the book now reads much like a screenplay adaptation, even though it came first.

There wasn't anything extra here, no added insight into Tyler Durden's character, no dirty scenes that didn't make it into the movie.

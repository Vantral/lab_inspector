According to this graph, the extinction of species will be growing until 2060, when it is estimated to be the highest - 50,000 extinct species per million per decade.

The speed of extinction will be getting higher each twenty years, in the first 20 years of the twenty-first century it will icrease twice, in the next 20 years it will get twice higher than the previous, in the following 20 years it will multiply 2,5 times again.

The most noticable feature is that most of the threats are due to human impact - over than 80 per cent, and slighly lower than 19 per cent of the threats is because of natural events.

Probably, the increase in the extinction is connected to the increase in human activities and human invasion into the nature.

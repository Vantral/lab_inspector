From time immemorial, sports involving animals have existed : taurokathapsia of Minoan Crete and modern tauromachia widely distributed today in many European countries, ancient chariot racing and horse riding in these, dozens of dog sports etc.

Sport is often traumatic and exacting for people too, but there is the difference between people and animals : for athletes it is their own choice while animals have no choice.

Indeed, the sport himself proved dangerous to the animals : intensive training can lead negative side effects for the animals' well-being.

And also there is a lot of sport in which committing mayhem on animals is an aim, as dog fighting or Spanish bullfighting.

So, the most part of dog sports are acceptable, because dogs are often glad to carry out master's orders.

On my opinion the personal contact between animal and trainer excuses the animal sport, and lots of animals can enjoy the sport when it's natural for them, but crippling animals for amusement should be forbidden.

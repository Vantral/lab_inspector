Reading novels has never been something I truly enjoyed, I just knew that books like that require much more than just understanding the plot, you have to fully dedicate yourself to analyze what author wants to say.

I have done it only once and the book which made me change my mind about novels was the novel which probably everyone has heard about at least once in their life - Â«The catcher in ryeÂ», a controversial book written in 1957 by a controversial personality of 20th century, J.

As I have already said reading the book is more appropriate for the people of Holden's age, it is just easier to get his point about Â«phonyÂ» things in society when you're going through the same era in your life, the era when you question everything and experience a lot of conflicts inside your psyches.

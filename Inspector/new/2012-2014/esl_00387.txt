It has become one of my favorite buildings because of its imposing size, beautiful ornament like a gilded onion domes and unusual and in some way strange colouring.

 After the careful observation I understood that Waldspirale is so unusual that you first have to get used to it.

Moreover, when I started to look at some details, I realized how many works and efforts had been enclosed in construction of such house.

It also has very contrast view in a way it looks magnificent and unconventional against the background of the modern well-developed city.

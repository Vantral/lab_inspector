The table above illustrates the changes in the birth rate in Australia since 1981 to 2006 according to interrogation of women at the age 40 44 years.

We see that the quantity of the women who haven't got a child at this age increased almost by half since the beginning of the research.

Also the number of women having many children reduced noticeably.

However some ratios keep stables : during 25 years of research the majority of mothers have two children.

We can note as well that indices in all the columns change gradually, there are no abrupt changes : the part of childless women rises smoothly and the quantity of people who have four or more children also declines fluently.

All this changes are typical for west countries; they could be provoked by women's emancipation, reducing of infant mortality and many other causes.

Theater as the place to entertain themselves has chosen the least amount of people in all three groups : 25% of migrants from English-speaking countries, 20% of migrants born in other countries and only 10% of people who were born in Australia.

However, it is not the most popular place among people that came from non-English-speaking countries as 55% of them prefer to spend their spare time in libraries, which is by 15% more than those visiting libraries from English-speaking countries and 17% more than Australians.

For instance, in both places of entertainment where the knowledge of language is required (theater and cinema), percents of visits of migrants who were born not in English-speaking countries are low or, at least, considerably lower than percents of visits of other people.

The theater is obviously very unpopular for all three categories and it could happened because of the image of theaters as an old-fashioned way to spend the time.

Probably, the situation can be improved by including lessons of drama in school program or creating student theaters in universities.

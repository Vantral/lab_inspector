Shopping is quite a dualistic process, which different people don't treat the same way.

Therefore if people can relax, get free from stress and daily problems, spend their time in a way to please themselves additionaly get such a considerable benefit as things necessary for life - what doubts can appear concerning the advantages of shopping's transformation into a hobby?

If your passion for buying things gets on an overly high degree, you may lose the sense of when you have to stop, and this way become a shopoholic.

Being a shopoholic usually goes with having debts, inability to manage will you finances well and therefore sometimes spoil relationships with your homemates and so on.

But even when not being a shopoholic, an excessive love to have shopping may cause the same problems just at a lower level.

So, my hypothesis that shopping's transformation into a hobby isn't an absolutely positive trend may obviously be right.

However, while not crossing the boarding line of common sense, making shopping your hobby probably isn't the worst thing to do.

Lyon's textbook on semantics devoted to homonymy and polysemy sets out to present various kinds of homonymy to students of linguistics and also explain the difference between homonymy and polysemy.

The author starts the description with the most common understanding of homonymy : "different words with the same form", and continues with its minor correction "by substituting lexeme for word".

However, after that he states that the definition remains imprecise and establishes another terminology.

The first notion given by the author is 'absolute homonymy'.
<The AT0><first ORD><notion NN1><given VVN><by PRP><the AT0><author NN1><is VBZ><' PUQ><absolute AJ0><homonymy NN1><' POS><. SENT>@
According to the text, this kind of homonymy is defined by three criteria : disconnectedness of meanings, all the word forms' identity and grammatical equivalence of identical forms.

Then the author gives a notion of a partial homonymy : as he explains further, the words are considered partial homonyms if one or two absolute homonymy criteria are fulfilled and there is minimally one identical form of the words.

However, in the following paragraphs he presents different degrees of homonymy and gives numerous examples, the majority of which are based on forms of verbs to find and to found.
<However AV0><, PUN><in PRP><the AT0><following AJ0><paragraphs NN2><he PNP><presents VVZ><different AJ0><degrees NN2><of PRF><homonymy NN1><and CJC><gives VVZ><numerous AJ0><examples NN2><, PUN><the AT0><majority NN1><of PRF><which DTQ><are VBB><based VVN><on PRP><forms NN2><of PRF><verbs NN2><to TO0><find VVI><and CJC><to TO0><found VVN><.

In the last paragraph on homonymy, the author mentions non-prototypical cases of the phenomena, illustrated with the noun 'rung' and one of the forms of the verb 'ring', and asserts that these cases are rarely taken into account as the instances of partial homonymy.
<In PRP><the AT0><last ORD><paragraph NN1><on PRP><homonymy NN1><, PUN><the AT0><author NN1><mentions VVZ><non-prototypical AJ0><cases NN2><of PRF><the AT0><phenomena NN2><, PUN><illustrated VVN><with PRP><the AT0><noun NN1><' POS><rung NN1><' POS><and CJC><one CRD><of PRF><the AT0><forms NN2><of PRF><the AT0><verb NN1><' POS><ring NN1><' PUQ><, PUN><and CJC><asserts VVZ><that CJT><these DT0><cases NN2><are VBB><rarely AV0><taken VVN><into PRP><account NN1><as PRP><the AT0><instances NN2><of PRF><partial AJ0><homonymy NN1><.

This remark is reasonable, especially in the light of the computer linguistics, as these forms are hardly considered as homonyms by the majority of people but are equivalent for a text analysis program.

The author continues the article with polysemy.
<The AT0><author NN1><continues VVZ><the AT0><article NN1><with PRP><polysemy NN1><. SENT>@
In general, he defines polysemy as a property of a single lexeme.
<In PRP><general AJ0><, PUN><he PNP><defines VVZ><polysemy NN1><as PRP><a AT0><property NN1><of PRF><a AT0><single AJ0><lexeme NN1><. SENT>@
Then he differentiates homonymy and polysemy and appeals to etymology and relatedness in meaning.

However, he notices that it is not obligatory for polysemous words to have a common etymology as they may be considered polysemous on the basis of a similar meaning.

As for the difference between homonymy and polysemy, they are traditionally considered to be different phenomena, but practically there are few cases of clear homonymy and, on the other hand, clear polysemy.

In general, the author failed to provide a full overview of homonymy and polysemy.

The main problem of the chapter is poor material used as examples of any kind of homonymy.

It is also typologically inappropriate : all the instances were taken from English, and there is no evidence that all possible instances of homonymy may be illustrated with English examples.

To improve the chapter, the author could have given several examples from other languages.

Another author's fault is the absence of some kinds of homonymy's descriptions.

One of them is homonymy between different word forms within one paradigm.

To give an example of this homonymy type, the author could have appealed to any language where nouns have case, such as Latin or Russian : ÐºÐ½Ð¸Ð³Ð¸ (book-Gen.

Pl.) This example is impossible in English as there are no cases in this language, but is quite common for the languages where this category is grammaticalised.

 Moreover, there are cases which are specific for English and may be considered as homonymy but are also missed in the chapter.

These are derivation pairs 'noun - verb' as hammer - to hammer, turn - to turn, look - to look etc.

The chapter would have been more trustworthy if the author had included these examples in the text, because even if the author aimed to make an introduction of homonymy based on English, he should have considered at least all the most common homonymy cases in English.
<The AT0><chapter NN1><would VM0><have VHI><been VBN><more AV0><trustworthy AJ0><if CJS><the AT0><author NN1><had VHD><included VVN><these DT0><examples NN2><in PRP><the AT0><text NN1><, PUN><because CJS><even AV0><if CJS><the AT0><author NN1><aimed VVN><to TO0><make VVI><an AT0><introduction NN1><of PRF><homonymy NN1><based VVN><on PRP><English NN1><, PUN><he PNP><should VM0><have VHI><considered VVN><at PRP><least AV0><all DT0><the AT0><most AV0><common AJ0><homonymy NN1><cases NN2><in PRP><English NN1><.

To sum up, the chapter from the book lacks typologically different material and does not mention all possible cases of homonymy.

It means that students of linguistics who study homonymy reading his book will not get full overview of the topic.

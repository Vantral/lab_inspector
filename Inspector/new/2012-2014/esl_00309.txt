One of the most considerable problems of Russian lexicography is that this area of study lacks a modern, comprehensive, user-friendly electronic resource which helps Russian learners to distinguish among different Russian synonyms semantically and collocationally.

The current study aims to create the pilot version of an electronic database owing to fill this gap.

Within this work different Russian synonyms were analyzed and described with the help of present dictionaries of Russian synonyms, explanatory dictionaries, Russian National Corpus's data, lexicographer's own linguistic feeling and questioning native speakers of the Russian language.

In addition, there was carried out research which examined, which method of writing the government of Russian words is the most comfortable and understandable for people who learn Russian as a foreign language.

Owing to this, the governments of all analyzed synonyms are written in a user-friendly format.

Moreover, authors of future textbooks and other academic resources for learners of Russian can also use the results of the current research while writing Russian words' government.

Besides, several students who know Russian at a proper level were asked to read the written descriptions of synonymic rows and mark fragments which are difficult in understanding.

Hence, the material of further resource created within this study was examined in real conditions and, what is more, the problematic areas of explanations were discovered and improved.

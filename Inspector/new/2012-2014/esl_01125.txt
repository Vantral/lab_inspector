In my opinion, the gap between children's and parents' generations does not, actually, exist.

To begin with, it is absolutely normal for a child to stop sharing everything with parents for a while.

In this way they form their own opinions and try to start being an independent individuality.

In most cases this period ends and teenagers start communicating with mother and father and with other adults even more and better than before.

What I am trying to say is that "gap between generations" is always created by people themselves.

Thus, parents just should be patient enogh and wait for some time not to hurt teenager's personal space.

This "gap" is just temporary and it stems only because of our nature.

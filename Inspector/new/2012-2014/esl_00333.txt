The other one question is the problem of different kinds of pollution - for example, because of an enormous amount of cars and lorries in cities the air and the water there becomes polluted and very dangerous for the health of its citizens, to say nothing about the noise pollution that has a bad influence on the psychological state of the people.

The first decision that is evident to take is that people should think how to stop using mainly the road type of transport and think about the active using of others instead.

Yes, it seems to be very expensive and difficult to spread, but I think that when the first vehicles are launched, people would be interested in them more than in their old ones and, as a result, it will lead to the appearance of economical models, as it was with cars.

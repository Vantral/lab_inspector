Habibullo Ismailovich Abdusamatov, the Head of Sun Space Researches in the Main Astronomical Observatory of Russian Academy of Sciences, said that the ice ages was caused by changes in the distance between the Earth and the Sun and few decades later the Little Ice Age would come and the temperature on Earth would be bellow about 1 2 degrees by Celsius.

In the second chapter of his well-known textbook Linguistic Semantics : an Introduction, John Lyons investigates the conditions when homonymy causes ambiguity.
<In PRP><the AT0><second ORD><chapter NN1><of PRF><his DPS><well-known AJ0><textbook NN1><Linguistic AJ0><Semantics NN1><: PUN><an AT0><Introduction NN1><, PUN><John NP0><Lyons NP0><investigates VVZ><the AT0><conditions NN2><when AVQ><homonymy NN1><causes VVZ><ambiguity NN1><. SENT>@
He establishes the notion of absolute and partial homonymy and three conditions which absolute homonyms should satisfy.
<He PNP><establishes VVZ><the AT0><notion NN1><of PRF><absolute AJ0><and CJC><partial AJ0><homonymy NN1><and CJC><three CRD><conditions NN2><which DTQ><absolute AJ0><homonyms NN2><should VM0><satisfy VVI><. SENT>@
If homonyms satisfy only one or two conditions they are called partial homonyms.
<If CJS><homonyms NN2><satisfy VVB><only AV0><one CRD><or CJC><two CRD><conditions NN2><they PNP><are VBB><called VVN><partial AJ0><homonyms NN2><. SENT>@
 This division is reasonable, but the description is quite imprecise.
<This DT0><division NN1><is VBZ><reasonable AJ0><, PUN><but CJC><the AT0><description NN1><is VBZ><quite AV0><imprecise AJ0><. SENT>@
First of all, the author does not mention that he is only dealing with lexical homonymy.
<First ORD><of PRF><all DT0><, PUN><the AT0><author NN1><does VDZ><not XX0><mention VVI><that CJT><he PNP><is VBZ><only AV0><dealing VVG><with PRP><lexical AJ0><homonymy NN1><. SENT>@
The backgrounds and consequences of the grammatical homonymy are different from the backgrounds and consequences of lexical homonymy, so they should be regarded separately.
<The AT0><backgrounds NN2><and CJC><consequences NN2><of PRF><the AT0><grammatical AJ0><homonymy NN1><are VBB><different AJ0><from PRP><the AT0><backgrounds NN2><and CJC><consequences NN2><of PRF><lexical AJ0><homonymy NN1><, PUN><so CJS><they PNP><should VM0><be VBI><regarded VVN><separately AV0><. SENT>@
Secondly, he mentions that the three conditions are logically independent which means that partial homonyms can be divided into classes depending on which of the conditions they satisfy.
<Secondly AV0><, PUN><he PNP><mentions VVZ><that CJT><the AT0><three CRD><conditions NN2><are VBB><logically AV0><independent AJ0><which DTQ><means VVZ><that CJT><partial AJ0><homonyms NN2><can VM0><be VBI><divided VVN><into PRP><classes NN2><depending VVG><on AVP><which DTQ><of PRF><the AT0><conditions NN2><they PNP><satisfy VVB><.

However, he does not specify whether these classes should be treated differently.
<However AV0><, PUN><he PNP><does VDZ><not XX0><specify VVI><whether CJS><these DT0><classes NN2><should VM0><be VBI><treated VVN><differently AV0><. SENT>@
He actually argues that partial homonyms can only cause ambiguity in special grammatical and lexical conditions, but I think that the ability to cause ambiguity may also depend on the class to which the partial homonyms belong.
<He PNP><actually AV0><argues VVZ><that CJT><partial AJ0><homonyms NN2><can VM0><only AV0><cause VVI><ambiguity NN1><in PRP><special AJ0><grammatical AJ0><and CJC><lexical AJ0><conditions NN2><, PUN><but CJC><I PNP><think VVB><that CJT><the AT0><ability NN1><to TO0><cause VVI><ambiguity NN1><may VM0><also AV0><depend VVI><on PRP><the AT0><class NN1><to PRP><which DTQ><the AT0><partial AJ0><homonyms NN2><belong VVB><.

 In addition, regarding the conditions of ambiguity the author considers only one example ('found' - 'to find' and 'found' - 'to found').
<In PRP><addition NN1><, PUN><regarding PRP><the AT0><conditions NN2><of PRF><ambiguity NN1><the AT0><author NN1><considers VVZ><only AV0><one CRD><example NN1><( PUL><' PUQ><found VVN><' PUQ><- PUN><' PUQ><to TO0><find VVI><' PUQ><and CJC><' PUQ><found VVN><' PUQ><- PUN><' PUQ><to TO0><found VVN><' PUQ><) PUR><.

As he mentions, the conditions are very complicated and various, therefore some other examples, both from English and other languages, would be helpful.

 Then Lyons regards polysemy.
<Then AV0><Lyons NP0><regards VVZ><polysemy NN1><. SENT>@
He claims that there are two criteria to distinguish homonymy and polysemy : the etymology and the relatedness of meaning.
<He PNP><claims VVZ><that CJT><there EX0><are VBB><two CRD><criteria NN2><to TO0><distinguish VVI><homonymy NN1><and CJC><polysemy NN1><: PUN><the AT0><etymology NN1><and CJC><the AT0><relatedness NN1><of PRF><meaning NN1><. SENT>@
However, he does not specify whether the relatedness of meaning should be based on some semantic criteria developed by linguists or on the speaker's intuition which can be investigated statistically.
<However AV0><, PUN><he PNP><does VDZ><not XX0><specify VVI><whether CJS><the AT0><relatedness NN1><of PRF><meaning NN1><should VM0><be VBI><based VVN><on PRP><some DT0><semantic AJ0><criteria NN2><developed VVN><by PRP><linguists NN2><or CJC><on PRP><the AT0><speaker NN1><'s POS><intuition NN1><which DTQ><can VM0><be VBI><investigated VVN><statistically AV0><. SENT>@
Then he claims that the etymological criterion in general supports the native speaker's intuition about particular lexemes.
<Then AV0><he PNP><claims VVZ><that CJT><the AT0><etymological AJ0><criterion NN1><in PRP><general AJ0><supports VVZ><the AT0><native AJ0><speaker NN1><'s POS><intuition NN1><about PRP><particular AJ0><lexemes NN2><. SENT>@
However, there are cases when these two contradict each other.
<However AV0><, PUN><there EX0><are VBB><cases NN2><when AVQ><these DT0><two CRD><contradict VVB><each DT0><other NN1><. SENT>@
He does not explain how we should deal with these cases, or which criterion is more relevant.
<He PNP><does VDZ><not XX0><explain VVI><how AVQ><we PNP><should VM0><deal VVI><with PRP><these DT0><cases NN2><, PUN><or CJC><which DTQ><criterion NN1><is VBZ><more AV0><relevant AJ0><. SENT>@
He also does not mention whether there are any other criteria which can be approved in these cases.
<He PNP><also AV0><does VDZ><not XX0><mention VVI><whether CJS><there EX0><are VBB><any DT0><other AJ0><criteria NN2><which DTQ><can VM0><be VBI><approved VVN><in PRP><these DT0><cases NN2><. SENT>@
Finally, there are no reasons why we have to distinguish between homonymy and polysemy altogether.
<Finally AV0><, PUN><there EX0><are VBB><no AT0><reasons NN2><why AVQ><we PNP><have VHB><to TO0><distinguish VVI><between PRP><homonymy NN1><and CJC><polysemy NN1><altogether AV0><. SENT>@
To summarize I would say that in this chapter Lyons succeeded in providing basic information about homonymy and its connection to ambiguity.

However, some more examples and more precise statements would improve his arguments.

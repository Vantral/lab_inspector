Despite the abundance of research on emotion terms in different languages, there have been little typological studies in this area.

The current paper is a part of a larger project aimed at creating a semantic 'map' of emotions in different languages.

Particularly, we examine emotion type 'pride' in the French language.

 main task is to find with a help of the dictionaries all words representing 'pride' and divide them into some groups based on their semantic features and syntactic patterns.

The resulting 'map' of 'pride' subtypes is then compared to its Russian counterpart in order to discover similarities and differences between them.

Although we could not create a clear-cut semantic 'map', some subtypes were discovered.

Collected data also demonstrated that there are certain similarities between French and Russian systems.

For instance, there is a tendency to reduce number of words used in the spoken language.

The most common and also semantically neutral expressions Ãªtre fier and Ð³Ð¾ÑÐ´Ð¸ÑÑÑÑ are used in a majority of contexts, whereas more notional words s' enorgueillir or se prÃ©valoir became outdated.

Thus we clarified some typological similarities which will help us to expand the cross-language semantic 'map'.

The two graphs describe the human threats to planet and animal life and their possible results.

The first one shows the expectation of plant and animal species' extinction from the year 2000 to 2100 in tropical forests.

The second one shows the percentage of what causes those species' extinction.

One can see the major trend of an extinction expectation on the first graph.

From the 2000 the amount of disappearing species is predicted to be drastically growing, until it reaches its highest point in 2060, when fifty thousand of species per million are predicted to be gone.

After this point, the number decreases down to less than thirty thousand extinct species per million.

On the second graph, the most important thing to see is that the major threat to plant life is the human impact : 81\.

The first graph also shows that the growth of an amount of extinct species is predicted to be more and more rapid until 2060, and the most rapid decade is the one between 2040 and 2060.

After this year, the decrease of this amount is going to be decreasing solidly.

The second graph shows some significant information as well : according to it, the two major human negative influences on plant life are agriculture and harvesting.

However, the major natural influence is shown as 'other natural events': they take 11\.

Several other activities are shown as human impact on nature, such as development, logging, livestock, disturbance, etc.

They all take less than 10% from the whole picture (except for development, which is slightly more), and other human impact that is not shown on this graph takes only 5\.

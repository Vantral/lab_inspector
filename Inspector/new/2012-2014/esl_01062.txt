I think that in any conflict all the two parties are quilty.

Maybe the general cause is not the lack of knowledge, but the lack of compreshion.

Parents don't want to try walking in shoes of their children, they don't remember already that time, when they were teens and needed more freedom than before, in childhood.

And children can't figure out how much worries they give to adultes.

I think it isn't a knowledge, because adultes know how it is to be a teen, and children know which actions can get parents worried.

But both of the parties of conflict don't want to listen and, what's more important, to hear each other.

So, to avoid this lack of compreshion they need just to sit and hear themselves and opponents.

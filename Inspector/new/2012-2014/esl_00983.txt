On the one hand, ordering products via the Internet is believed to be the most convenient way of shopping since it does not require presence in a particular place or a substantial amount of time and can be done virtually anywhere provided there is a connection to the Internet.

In addition, the prices may be lower when ordering online because such shops, compared to traditional ones, do not have vast expenses to cover.

Needless to say, shopping on the Internet provides people with opportunity to obtain products unavailable in their country.

On the other hand, online shopping could turn into disaster as the chances to have a fake or low-quality product delivered are high because a consumer is unable to examine the item closely and has to rely on pictures and a description.

Apart from that, the vast majority of orders are sent by post that cannot be trusted due to its exceedingly low speed and frequent losses.

Moreover, in lots of cases it is impossible to get a necessary item because of its small size or weight, which causes wasting money on relatively random goods merely in order to get the parcel sent.

To sum up, online shopping has changed the habits of consumer society.

And still there is much room for improvement due to the overall insecurity of ordering goods online.

On balance, if the shopping on the Internet is regulated by relevant laws and becomes more secure in all its aspects, it may compete with traditional shops in scale and popularity and even leave them behind at some point in the future.

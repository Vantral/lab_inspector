In this report I am going to comment on a diagram providing the information about a series of stages that consumer goods go through before they appear as produce which is ready for sale.

To begin with, keeping raw materials and manufactured components in the storage is considered to be the initial stage in the manufacturing process.

Subsequently, they are transferred to the production planning stage.

Actually, during the production planning stage producers decide how and in what quantities the available materials will be used to create finished goods.

The finished products are manufactured based on the requirements of the design stage that comes from the product research.

Then, after assembly, the produce is inspected and tested to ensure that only high quality products are put into packaging and offered for sale.

It is obvious that market research also regulates the production.

Such research has the important role for design and advertising of the produce to suit consumer demands which is often inconstant.

Moreover, market research serves to stabilize future sales through analyzing the current trends and planning of the production.

To sum up, consumer goods manufacturing depends on the feedback of researches, which make up a complex process.

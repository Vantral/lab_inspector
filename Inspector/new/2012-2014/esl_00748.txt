Eventually, graffiti could be dangerous to the government ideology as in general that way of expressing points of view cannot be censored, is located in public places where crowds of people can see it and the artists who create this type of artworks are as a rule radically disposed.

In conclusion it has to be said that graffiti since it is not an elitist type of art could never stand in the same line as work of Renoir or Michelangelo, although they do not deserve the status of vandalism because it requires human effort whereas vandalism is a way of delivering from excess energy.

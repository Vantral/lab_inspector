Flying by plains makes getting even to the other side of the Earth take us less than a day; but the work of the airports can easily be stopped because of some weather conditions, and therefore people sometimes get locked in one place when they already have to be somewhere else.

For example, the plenty of computer programs for solving mathematical problems (from calculators to the ones that can build any graph) makes it not obligatory to know even the nuts and bolts of this science; but mathematics is not just a practical thing; it is kind of "gym for human's mind", and forgetting how to do it is not a good news for your brain.

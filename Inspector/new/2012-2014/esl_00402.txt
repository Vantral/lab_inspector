Despite the fact that dative constructions in Russian language have been repeatedly described in different papers and so many times discussed, this subject is still not fully explored.

In fact, this type of constructions is a sort of impersonal sentence.

It is known that a great number of linguists have been making attempts to define this concept and its characteristics however no universal definition has been made by now.

   For "Dative constructions in Russian" course paper the goal is to classify old constructions and simultaneously find new ones.

Due to the fact, that this theme is, indeed, quite vast, the course paper's topic is converged to examine one of characteristic features of Russian dative constructions, namely, subjectness.

The interesting fact is that whereas among people from 20 to 49 the number of obese people were increasing slightly, firstly from 5% to 10% then from 10% to 25 per cent, however, from the age group of 50 59 there had been a great increase to a level of more than 50 per cent and almost the same number remained among the people from 60 to 69.

Surely, it has some connection with the fact that after 50 men and women are likely to have more problems with health than the youth, and also pay less attention to their fit.

All in all, it is quite natural that younger people are more likely to have ideal weight and to be underweight than elderly because of their youth, health and desire to look nice and sexy.

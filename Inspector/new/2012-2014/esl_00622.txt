The graph and circle graph show the prospective data about what is going to happen with plant and animal species during the 21st century and that starting from 2000 many species are under the threat to become extinct.

It is clear that the extinction reaches its peak in 2060 : around 50,000 per million species are in dangerous and it is possible that they will become extinct.

It is shown that the lowest level was in 2000 - only 5,000 species per million became extinct.

The highest level of danger can come from agriculture, harvesting and some natural events (18,7%, 14,4% and 11,7% accordingly).

After 2060 it is noticed moderate fall of endangered animals' and plants' species.

Then she noticed that there was an uncomfortable tension in the audience and changed her outfit in just a few seconds right on the stage and marked that she was quiet privileged in changing what people think of her in 10 seconds.

Also Cameron Russell showed a rather revealing picture with her and a man and said that, actually, at that moment she had never had a boyfriend in a real life and had felt really embarrassed and uncomfortable while taking this photo session.

The model explained that how we look always have a huge impact on our lives and there is nearly nothing we can do to transform this in any way.

Secondly, Cameron said that when as a teenager once she had been driving with her friend who had been an awful driver and, thus, had run a red, they had got pulled over and all it had taken had been "Sorry, officer," and they had been on their way.

  To sum up, she said that being a model is not something that labels a person, a model is just a profession, photos of the models do not have anything in common with a real person under the image created by "hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production".

What she was trying to tell us about is quite simple and not new at all as children are always brought up with the idea that nobody should be judged by their appearance.

However, this point is often understood in a different way : if a person is not pretty enough or has different imperfections, it does not mean that this person is not interesting to talk to, for instance.

Cameron Russell told us about the other side of this principle, that even a person with the ideal appearance should not be labelled in any way.

It is a well known fact that the academic abilities vary throught each person thus some people came to an idea of diving people into groups in such educational institutions as schools, colleges and universities according to these abilities.

On the one hand, the speed of acuiring data of each individual determines the speed of the whole group in general that is why the groups with the highest academical abilities will be the most intelligent and developed ones.

On the other hand, the idea of the separating people according to their mental abilities gives an idea of the discrimitation and thus results in humiliation issues among the groups of different levels.

More than that, in a group of different levels of development there is a high probability of the consultation cases between the people of different mental abilities what therefore leads to the general decrease of the educational level of the whole group.

In conclusion it has to be said that people, whenever they are divided into groups according to their abilities or not, will still distinguish some subgroups or separate individuals inside this group.

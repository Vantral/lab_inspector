In the chapter âHomonymy and Polysemy" Lyons describes this phenomena and gives criteria for distinguishing it.

Lyons begins with improving traditional definition of absolute homonymy because he finds it not complete and clear enough.

While homonymy is a relationship between two or more distinct lexemes, polysemy, or multiple meaning, is a property of single lexemes.

The author gives two main criteria.
<The AT0><author NN1><gives VVZ><two CRD><main AJ0><criteria NN2><. SENT>@
According to the etymological criterion which is usual supported by the native speakers' untutored intuition, two words are homonymes if they have different historical sources.

SENT>@
On the assumption of another criterion, the relatedness of meaning, it is also possible to distinguish homonymy from polysemy because one of the principle factors operative in semantic change is metaphorical extension.

However, sometimes people by mistake consider homonyms as one word with multiple meaning because of so called popular etymology which is wrong historical background of words invented by ordinary people.

Although in this chapter the author explains very clearly what is the difference between homonymy and polysemy and provides the criteria for distinguishing them, it is still not detailed enough and has lack of terminology.
<Although CJS><in PRP><this DT0><chapter NN1><the AT0><author NN1><explains VVZ><very AV0><clearly AV0><what DTQ><is VBZ><the AT0><difference NN1><between PRP><homonymy NN1><and CJC><polysemy NN1><and CJC><provides VVZ><the AT0><criteria NN2><for PRP><distinguishing VVG><them PNP><, PUN><it PNP><is VBZ><still AV0><not XX0><detailed AJ0><enough AV0><and CJC><has VHZ><lack NN1><of PRF><terminology NN1><.

The certain advantage of this work is accurate structure and clarity.

Homonymy and polysemy can be easily distinguished in the most of cases.

The main point of criticism is that the author only mentions there are some exceptions and does not give enough examples, explanations and recommendations how to make a decision in difficult cases.
<The AT0><main AJ0><point NN1><of PRF><criticism NN1><is VBZ><that CJT><the AT0><author NN1><only AV0><mentions VVZ><there EX0><are VBB><some DT0><exceptions NN2><and CJC><does VDZ><not XX0><give VVI><enough DT0><examples NN2><, PUN><explanations NN2><and CJC><recommendations NN2><how AVQ><to TO0><make VVI><a AT0><decision NN1><in PRP><difficult AJ0><cases NN2><.

For instance, if the intuition of native speakers and historical background of words are not coherent which can happen in different languages and has to possible varieties.

First, two close meanings of a word can in process of time become so far that it is hard to find a something common.

This phenomenon is illustrated by Lyons with an example of the homonyms 'sole' ('bottom of foot or shoe') and 'sole' ('a kind of fish') which the average speaker of the language think of as being unrelated in fact come from one source.

Such words can be found in other languages, for instance, russian words 'Ð¼Ð¸Ñ' ('world') and 'Ð¼Ð¸Ñ' ('peace') are now marked in dictionaries as homonyms although they have common historical background.

Second, due to popular etymology homonyms can be considered as multiple meanings.

Nowadays a number of speakers assume that 'shock' like in 'a shock of corn' and 'shock' as in 'shock of hair' while in reality they have different origins.

Another example is a couple of russian words 'ÑÑÑÑ' ('lynx') and 'ÑÑÑÑ' ('trot').

Although the author provides examples for such cases, he does not give any additional criteria which are necessary in such cases.
<Although CJS><the AT0><author NN1><provides VVZ><examples NN2><for PRP><such DT0><cases NN2><, PUN><he PNP><does VDZ><not XX0><give VVI><any DT0><additional AJ0><criteria NN2><which DTQ><are VBB><necessary AJ0><in PRP><such DT0><cases NN2><. SENT>@
It could be a time criterion implying how long should native speakers consider two words to be homonyms instead of multiple meanings or conversely.

A criterion for detecting polysemy could be the existence of similar metaphorical extensions.

The words 'table' and 'desk' are a good example for such a criterion.

Another disadvantage of this work is the particular description of homonymy and, as a consequence, lack of terminology.

For instance, Lyons refers to grammatical homonymy but does not even mention homographs, homophones and heteronyms.

To sum up, this text can be useful for non-linguists while professionals should be provided more detailed information.

People, who discuss about this problem, are divided into two sides : first one is talking that interest is beyond the salary, other people think that the main goal of working is the earning of money, so it can't be ignored.

On the other hand, there is a point of view that people go to work not for having fun, but for earning some cash and people, who change their job just because it's boring just didn't grow up enough for adult life.

Some people just can't spend their lifetime for not profitable job, because they have those, who they are responsible for : a man, who has three children and wife, who doesn't work on high-paid job, have to find a job which will provide his family a life, which will be happy enough, no matters interesting this job or not.

I think that the truth is in the golden middle between good salary and interest : your job should be profitable enough to live a normal life without some cash restrictions in main things and it should be so interesting for you that you will go to it without sense of doom.

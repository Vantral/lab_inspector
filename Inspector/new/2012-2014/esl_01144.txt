In this report I am going to describe the general steps of products manufacturing applying to the detailed diagram.

To begin with, raw materials and manufactured components are being put into the storage.

Secondly, after all production-planning consumer goods are being collected, inspected, and tested.

It is important not to forget to send all test results to people working on the design of the product after that, as the design affects production plans a lot.

It comes as no surprise that before the final shipping consumer goods should be packed.

Those are all obligatory stages after which we can see those products in shops.

However, that is not the end, because after selling the product market researchers should do their work, results of which will affect the way how that product is advertised, designed and packed.

 Moreover, the results of sales influence production plans, as well.

Thus, everything is interdependent, as you can see.

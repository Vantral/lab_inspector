Numerous reasons were given, such as : "Both, because government gives an official status to the environmental movement, and independent organizations make you think you are free to decide, they give you sense of responsibility", "They will have money and there will not be any problems with organization", "Only independent organizations can work in Russia, where most governmental organizations are highly unefficient and corrupted".

Conclusion
<Conclusion NN1>@
To sum up, it's difficult to say whether people are truly aware of the local environmental volunteer organizations, because of few information they have due to unpopularity of the green movement.

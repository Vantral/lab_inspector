Travelling by metro in the day time might be the most reliable way to get to some point on time, but during the rush hour it is awful because there are a lot of people that are unfriendly and the only goal they have is to get on train.

Although they try to solve the latter but it doesn't work : they made these special lines for buses but there are still cars on it and after snowing snowdrifts are hindering the path.

Trams could be a solution but the routes are being reduced, so there are hardly any places, where you can get by tram.

Also it requires a change in traditional life, because there everybody from kids to elderlies uses bicycle and I find difficulty trying to imagine elder Russians cycling, it takes time to accustom to it.

Recently I have come round one funny idea, I don't know whether it is true or not, but it sounds like this : in Paris (France) they want to impose high taxes on individual car and open a lot of cheap rent-a-car offices so that person rather share car rental with somebody than have his own car.

But I think that for Moscow isn't it that is the most important : firstly, we have to cope with bad planning of interchanges and organization of traffic; secondly, especially in winter - to improve snow cleaning.

Books for children are often supposed to be lightweight, simple and unserious.

People think that what is written for children is only to entertain them.

Books can be funny or make little people cry, but they are just simple stories, which don't contain some great ideas and thoughts.

Because what children are waiting from book - is to be interesting : it might be full of actions, jokes and some stupid situations.

I definitely disagree with this idea, because many children's books can be understood from other point of view, when you're adult.

You can discover that a book which was your favorite when a child after rereading it is really thought-making and it becomes your favorite another time .

The best known example of this, I think, is 'The Little Prince' by Antoin de Saint-Exupery which is the story for all times and all ages.

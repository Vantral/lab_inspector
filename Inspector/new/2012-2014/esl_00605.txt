The pie chart and the line graph show some data and predictions about plants and animal extinctions and the reasons why plants could die out.

The line graph illustrates the present and the predicted number of plants and animals which became or would become extinct between 2000 and 2100.

A steady increase of extinctions could be seen between 2000 (about 5000 per million) and 2060 (50000 per million).

The peak of extinctions would be in 2060 when the number of plants and animals dyeing out will reach 50000 per million.

Between 2060 and 2010 the decrease from 50000 to just lower 30000 is expected, comparin to 2000 that are very high firgures.

Almost 81% of possible plant extinctions are caused by human impact.

The most serious damages to plant life is caused by agriculture (almost 19%) and harvesting (almost 15%).

About 19% of natural events especially natural disasters (7%) cause plants extinction.

To sum up, a great number of animals and plants will die out by 2100, mainly because of human activity, that influences environment in a negative way.

The first graph is showing a prediction of extinction rate of animal and plant species in tropical forests in the near future.

It presents, that the extinction rate will increase dramatically from about 5,000 species per decade now to 50,000 in 2060.

From there it will be slowly decreasing to about 28,000 species per decade in 2100.

It shows, that the human impact is 4 times more harmful then natural events, and proceeds us an information about it distribution.

Also, it is given, that agriculture and harvesting are the most dangerous threats and natural disasters are more than two times less harmful than any of them.

	Based on these two graphs, we can make a prediction, that in the future, due to increasing population and needs, humanity will consume more and more natural resources, violating the nature and causing the extinction of plant and animal species, especially in the tropical forests - one of the most productive regions.

However, the boy happened to be a very smart and yet terribly disobedient child, so by his fifth birthday already my sister was eager to send him to school, where he would be given an opportunity to apply his sharp mind and infinite energy.

A year later, even though my nephew was the youngest pupil in the class, his marks were the highest, and all the teachers admired him despite of his discipline which sometimes appeared to be quite poor.

If we tend to suppose that the first years at school are given to children in order to have them taught how to study and to have their talents discovered, then beginning formal education from the age of four would be a truly great idea.

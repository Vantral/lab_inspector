There is no doubt that a company should create the best possible conditions for its employees in order to have the work done in a most efficient way.

On the one hand, it is obvious that people show the best results when they are provided with appropriate conditions which allow them to concentrate on their work and not to be distracted by problems and distressing thoughts.

Moreover, in case there is job satisfaction, people tend to be the best in the area they specialise in and thus contribute to the success of the company they appreciate working in.

Apart from that, incentives may give the feeling of being needed, which is the part of the state of happiness, and simultaneously encourage people to achieve more, which adds to the benefit of the company.

On the other hand, happiness may sometimes cause laziness since happy people do not require anything and do not have to strive for success.

Thus, raising incentives may not lead to the company's profit but result in exactly the opposite - money losses in useless attempts to satisfy the demands and increase happiness of employees.

Therefore, managers of the company should be aware of the atmosphere among the people they supervise and alter the course of the 'happiness policy' according to it.

People have always been prone to share their opinion with others, and internet blogging is just a one of the ways to perform your point of view.

In my view, blog is not a genre, it's just a new platform that allows people to reflect, share opinions(like journals, magazines etc.

There are blogs about traveling, with a lot of photos, blogs about everyday life, that can be quite interesting to read, with a lot of beautiful descriptions and exciting facts(but some of those are pretty boring), beauty-blogs, culinary blogsâ¦

On the one hand blog writing has a lot of advantages : it's free and available to everyone, so anybody who has something he wants to share is able to do it.

Besides that, if another internet user is looking for some special information his chance to find such information increases significantly.

Everybody writes what he wants, and it's already difficult to separate the good blogs from the bad by reason of their excessive number.

What about me, i'm not keen on surfing the net and reading blogs, but I believe that in spite of the above, somebody can benefit from blogs.

To conclude, if you have enough free time and desire, you are likely to find blog that you will read with pleasure and interest.

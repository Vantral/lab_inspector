The graph and chart given in the task show us the plant and animals extinctions per million species per decade and potential percentage of different kinds of threats to plant life correspondingly.

But the significant thing is that after 2050 the damage of flora and fauna sharply extents to 50,000 extinctions, but on the contrary, in 2060 year the figures of tropical forests destruction goes down.

Human impact should be compared to natural influence, that is only the eighth part of human damagable activities, on plant life because the former is much less than the first one.

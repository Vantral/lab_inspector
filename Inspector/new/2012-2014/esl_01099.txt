The given diagram shows us the typical stages of consumer goods manufacturing, including the process by which information is fed back to earlier stages to enable adjustment.

We can observe correlation between manufacture and product research.

Also, producing moments depend on organizational moments.

For example, production planning depends on design and packaging depends on market research.

  According to the information from the diagram, consumer goods manufacturing is very elaborate process, which include many actions and steps.

Some people believe that schlools should choose students by their academic abilities, others are sure that there is more use in having students with different abilities in one school.

There are people who argue that the quality of education at each school would be higher, if they selected students with the particular academic abilities.

I agree, that thus the process of education would be faster and the education program would fit the majority of students and they would feel comfortable during their studies.

But I still believe that the schools benefit when there are different types of students in them, as they can teach each other something useful and to show a good example in the things they are capable of.

On the whole, there can be different views on this problem and, maybe, there should be different ways of how schools select students.

Thus, the schools and the students would be free in their choice and would focus on what they appreciate most in the process of studying - the diversity or the quality.

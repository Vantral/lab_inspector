Last Friday we have been to a lecture of a great linguist, Maria Polinsky.

At this time, she was speaking about hierarchical structures in language.

There exists 2 types of such structures in grammar : finite state grammar and phrase structure grammar.

The language has a wide range of hierarchical features, but can we prove that in reality of the language there does exist a structure?

 Surprisingly, there is an answer.

When comparing the language of native and heritage speakers, we can see how some implicational rules are real.

For example, if a non-native speaker forgets about the number in Russian, he/she does not forget about the person, but forgets about the gender, and if a heritage speaker remembers about the gender, they will remember about the number and the person as well.

Moreover, mistakes in gender seem to native speakers less noticeable than mistakes in person.

Many experiments were made on this issue and the conclusion always is that if a person forgets about some points in language hierarchy, he/she forgets everything that goes upper in this structure, but does not forget stages that stand at the beginning of this hierarchy.

So the language really is structured!

The conception according to which brain will get an ability to operate with the external devices dates back 40 years and today signals that our brain sends to our body can be interpreted in the program code and, for example, sent to the robotic hands or legs making them operate the way brain wants.

This software is now used to create the platforms for future generation gaming to get a commercial profit from this idea but in fact such an invention with a help of robot-building will soon introduce a brand new fully robotized bodies for our brains to operate.

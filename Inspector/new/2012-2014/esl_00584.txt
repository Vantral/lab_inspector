The 2010 chart demonstrates approximately 72 per cents of ideal weight youngsters, whereas, according to the same graph, more older age groups are less and less likely to have an ideal weight, giving way to risingly high level of obese and overweighted people percentage - only 5 per cents of the eldest group have a perfect weight.

As a result, generally, people visit cinema more often than any other place - except for new migrants from non-English-speaking countries who prefer to improve their language skills while visiting library.

They also go to the zoo less actively compared with other people who are more likely to look at animals and spend time with their families than read books or watch a performance.

Moreover, theatre became the least popular entertainment - neither people born in Australia or in America and Great Britain, nor migrants from other countries prefer theatre to other places to visit.

Besides, English-speaking migrants do that more likely than other people : it's probably because of their ability to understand a good play and the availability of famous theatres (like La Scala) or actors (like Hue Jackman or, for example, Tim Minchin; but stand-up comic shows were not included to the list so I don't sure if calling Tim Minchin less popular than animals or books is correct), while Australians find drama boring and people whose English isn't good enough yet just don't want to waste their time.

All in all, while well-speaking migrants get knowledge about Australian culture and visit zoos where famous endemic animals are presented and new migrants are studying English people who born in Australia spend less time for those activities.

The bar charts given show us the assessments of weight of inhabitants of Newtown in two time periods - 1950 and sixty years later - in 2010.

First, we can observe the main trends that both charts have - it is having an ideal weight percentage higher the other states at the age from 20 to 39 in both time periods.

Further we may see the differences that are shown there - in 50-s the percentage of people with an ideal weight remains slightly constant, with the years - from 20 to 69 - the percentage of people with an ideal weight falls from 70 per cent to 45.

It is much less, than people had in 2010, where the percentage of those, who had normal weight percentage is decreasing from 70 per cent to 5 by the age of 60 69 years.

However, the percentage of people with obese weight is rising constantly among those, who lived in 2010, while in 1950 such people composed the lowest percentage of the whole chart.

The percentage of those, who had underweight was between 40 to 15 per cent in 50-s, in comparison to those who lived in 2010 - only about 20 to 10 per cent.

The overweight number of people is approximately equal in both groups.

To conclude, we may see that in 1950 inhabitants of Newtown were tending to have an ideal weight over their whole life in contrast to people from 2010, which had tendency to have an obese weight.

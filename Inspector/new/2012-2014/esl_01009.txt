Firstly, at this age children only start reading, some of them speaking, it is more suitable for them to go to the kindergarten, where they would have a lot of time talking, playing with each other and get some basic educational skills.

That's why I think it is a good idea to begin formal school until children are seven or eight.

On the other hand, going to school as early as possible can be a good way to educate people.

The position of some parents is the earlier start - the better result you will achieve.

At the conclusion I want to say that every parent has to choose the future of their children at the young age, but they should ask children prepare them to begin education or not.

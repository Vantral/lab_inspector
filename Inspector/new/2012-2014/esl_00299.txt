Coarticulation refers to changes in the articulation of a speech segment depending on preceding and upcoming segments (Cohen & Massaro, 1993 :3).

Due to articulation processes some phonetic characteristics of sounds can be changed or new type of sound can be produced.

As the main objective of phonetic study is to describe precisely all the phones of human speech voice coarticulation has to be portrayed as well.

Present work is focused on the research of assimilation processes occurring in consonant clusters of obstruent and sonorant sounds in Modern Standard Russian.

Current study suggests presentence of the devoicing of sonorant segment in the concerned consonant cluster.

To confirm the above-stated hypothesis contexts accommodated required consonant cluster were composed.

The analysis demonstrared that the level of coarticulation depends on the position of cluster, lexical stress of the word that contains the cluster, prosodic stress and the characteristic of the backward and forward vowels.

The outcomes of this research might help developing speech recognition software and giving a precise definition for the notion of 'coarticulation' which has not been given yet and is ambiguous with two relative terms - assimilation and accommodation.

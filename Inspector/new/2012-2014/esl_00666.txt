Firs of all, one of the problems that may be caused by the increase of life expectancy is the potential rise of the number of non-working elder people, and, what is vital, some of them might be in fact willing to work, but struggling to find a job because, according to the law, they have already reached the retirement age.

Seniors are more likely to have serious health problems than younger people, which means that the government would have to invest a lot in the support; it could be if not damaging, than at least noticeable for a state budget.

However, this problem might be solved with the ruse of the taxes : this would be people themselves to invest in their own health.

Despite several researches on assimilation and coarticulation the obstruent+lateral consonant combinations have remained outside the scope of scientific research.

The current study investigates, how these sounds affect the voiced/voiceless pronunciation of each other, whether assimilation rules can be formulated or the influence is coarticulation.

It also studies, whether the influence depends on the following vowel and on the position of the consonant cluster (inside one word or in the external sandhi position).

We used audio recordings of five speakers containing sentences with the following contexts : voiceless stop/fricative + velarized/palatalized lateral + stressed/reduced vowel ([Ñ]/[Ñ] + [Ð»]/[Ð»']+[A]/[Ñ] (16 different contexts).

With the help of the program Praat we measured and calculated the percentage of the length of the voiced part to the whole consonant cluster.

We found that the percentage of the voiced part is much lower in the contexts with a reduced vowel.

However, it does not depend on the position of the cluster and the percentage highly varies by different speakers, which means that no assimilation rules control the influence, so it can only be coarticulation.

The outcomes of the research can help us learn more about interaction of sounds in spoken language.

As we may conclude, with rising the quantity of students enrolled there is not only increasing of overseas enrolments but also falling down the quantity of enrolled students form places near Bristol University.

So, as we may conclude, the University of Bristol eventually became more popular with overseas student enrolments than with local ones.

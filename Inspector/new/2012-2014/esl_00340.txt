Despite the increasing amount of electronic bases and instruments which are of high importance for linguists, there still exists no global database of Russian synonyms which would not only contain enumeration of words but also provide information on semantic and collocational peculiarities as well as common meaning and common collocations of synonyms with the examples and would be aimed at unprepared users.

Within the framework of the collective course project our group started to create such resource because it would be highly valuable for future theoretical researches, for linguists and for native speakers as well as learners of Russian language.

Main aim is to set up a foundation on which the global database with approximately 4000 entries will be created in future.

In this course project we collectively make a pilot version of it with 63 entries, each person describes 9 synonymic sets.

This work focuses on two aspects - theoretical and practical.

The impact on theoretical part of creation of the database is creation of metalanguage and templates of description of different semantic classes of words.

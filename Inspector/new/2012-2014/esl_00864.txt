In the next five years tourism in all parts of the world increased with almost identical speed by more or less 10 million.

At the same time the index of Central and Eastern reached the peak at 90 million, catching up with the North American number.

Which means that if she has a job that she does not like, she spends almost a third of her life doing something against her own will, which inevitably leads to depression and not willing to go to work at all and does not leave any room for enjoying the earned money.

Every job has routine parts that cannot be avoided, so one should try to find a place where the money is good enough to support herself and a family, maybe something extra for the holidays and a big flat-screen TV, but still a job where she can feel appreciated and useful and where she can do something you like.

To conclude, I would like to say that although salary is, of course, important, it is very hard to work at a job that you do not like, so everyone should always try to find a compromise.

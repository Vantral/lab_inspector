People have been exploring space with their eyes and telescopes since ancient times and more than fifty years by satellites and space travelling.

In the twentieth century each country explored space by its own in order to be on the first place and some people claim that nowadays situation is the same.

During the whole twentieth century there were two counties that had significant space programs - USSR and the USA.

Then space exploration was a question of national pride and there was almost no international cooperation.

But I think that there is still little international effort because each country has its own space program and focuses on different things.

I guess that there are two ways of space exploration evolution in the future, but both depend on political relations between countries.

The first one leads to closer cooperation and international effort, creating corporate space project.

To sum up, I want to say that nowadays space exploration is more to do with national pride, but situation may turn into international effort in the future if there will appropriate conditions.

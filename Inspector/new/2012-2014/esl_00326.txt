It cannot be denied that dictionaries which describe synonyms and differences in their meanings are vitally important in the process of learning a foreign language.

The problem is that even the most famous and the most frequently used dictionaries of Russian synonyms (such as dictionaries edited by Abramov and Aleksandrova) contain only lists of synonyms, but no information whatsoever about their differences in usage.

 We have to describe the semantic and collocational differences among words in several synonymic entries in a simple language, so that linguistically inexperienced learners of the Russian language can easily comprehend lexicographic information and are able to make correct distinctions amongst different synonyms in practice.

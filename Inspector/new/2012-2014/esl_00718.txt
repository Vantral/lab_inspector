Nick is just an intermediator between Gatsby and his sweetheart (Nick's cousin) Daisy.

 Gatsby tries to retrieve Daisy and this is the main plot of this novel.

The very end of this story is the death of Gatsby (maybe it's the most tragic part of the novel, apart from the accident and the death of Myrtle).

So, on the one hand it's a story about Daisy's hypocrisy, greed, meanless and, on the other hand, Gatsby's pure unrequired love.

This story has a fungible overextended plot with long introduction, sluggish suspense, quiet climax.

But incompleteness of the novel gives a certain charm and a definite moral message for this story.

To tell you the truth, I've decided to read this novel just because of its popularity in these latter days.

From 2000 to 2040th the extinction will increase steadily with approximately similar speed.

However, starting from the year 2040 within the next 20 years there will be an enormous increase in the extinction and it will achieve its peak.

In these 20 years about 30000 extinctions per milllion will happen and in the year 2060 it will consume 50000 extionctions per million.

Comparing the graph and the chart we may presume that in the middle of the 21st century the harm done to the planet will achieve its culmination and this will lead to the extinctions.

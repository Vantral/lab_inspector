Some of them think that teenagers are always wrong, but the others consider that the problem is in parents.

In my point of view, everything depends on the situation.

Sometimes children are not right, sometimes their parents make mistakes.

However, I can write about this problem in general.

I guess that parents are too strict to their kids.

They always want them to be obedient, do what they say, but teenagers have their own character, feelings and opinions.

They are in such age when they want to show parents and other people that they are already adult and wanted parents to listen to them seriously.

However, we can also understand their parents.

They bring up their children, take care of them, so they make their children pay attention on them by strict ways.

At the same time, other people have their own opinions.

For example, most of the people think that computers and Internet are influenced on communication between relatives.

I can't help disagreeing with this opinion, but I guess it is not the main reason.

Besides, other people insist on fact that relatives just do not want to listen to each other and understand each other.

So I completely agree with it and understand it, because I had a lot of complicated situations when I and my parents just did not want to listen to ourselves.

In conclusion, I can say that the problem of children and parent communication has been existing for a long time.

I think every person is faced with different difficulties, but we should overcome them and try to listen to each other.

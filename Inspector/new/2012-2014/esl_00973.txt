If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologist classes, I would firstly teach them to think before write something, to understand primarily what they want to write.

I would show them how to compose plans, on my opinion it's very useful, because it would help to not lose the ideas, when they appear too fast, and also help to construct logical text without rewriting it a thousand times.

Moreover, I would explain them that there are a lot of styles of words, and there are words, which have the same meaning, but in a case it needs to use a word, which would be absolutely inconvenient in another situation.

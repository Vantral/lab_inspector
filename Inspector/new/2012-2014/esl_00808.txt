Our basic skills may suffer from that prevalence of modern technology, for example many taxi drivers or just drivers use GPS navigators, which designed to simplify the process of finding the right way or even more the shortest way.

These examples show that many people use modern technology to simplify their lives, but there are still the great number of drivers who use the time-honored map and still there are mathematicians who can count in head.

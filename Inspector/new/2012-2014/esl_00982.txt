The narration is not attached to any person hence it is quite comprehensive and objective, providing the reader with the whole view on the society, its peculiarities and the attitude of the main characters towards themselves, each other and the civilisation in general.

In other famous novels of this genre there are two sides of the conflict but, as far as "Brave New World" is considered, it is fascinating that Huxley depicts several people standing out of the crowd who, nevertheless, are different concerning values, desires and aims : at the beginning, there is Bernard Marx, who talks and behaves exceedingly oddly raising revulsion in people surrounding him.

In turn, the phrase he chooses - "O brave new world that has such people in it" - derives from the play "The Tempest" by Shakespeare where it is used almost in the same context : neither John in Huxley's novel nor Miranda in Shakespeare's play could not imagine how mistaken they were when uttering those words.

On the opposite, in the civilisation of "Brave New World" the control, surprisingly, is much more comprehensive as people's lives are predestined since the fertilising.

The state is purely totalitarian but owing to the social conditioning and other methods of supervision of physical and mental state, such as the special drug soma available to everybody, citizens are perfectly satisfied with their lives and love their servitude without any doubt.

I strongly recommend the book as it shows the profound comfort the humankind longs for and its other side which constitutes absence of life - genuine life with all its instability and moments of misery alternating with times of bliss, with self-improvement and contemplations about true values and the sense of existence - everything which makes it truly worthwhile.

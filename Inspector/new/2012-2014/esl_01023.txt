 As it is written in encyclopedia Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel.

I think that it is stupid to give a short summary of the book, because it is hard to tell someone about this book without spoiling it.

Even though the novel had been published approximately sixty years ago you got the idea that parts of this story are happening all around us everyday.

Bradbury described himself as "a preventor of futures, not a predictor of them" and we could easily draw parallels between the book and life around us.

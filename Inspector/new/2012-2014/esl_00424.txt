The purpose of this course paper is to examine and comprehensively describe voice coarticulation in obstruent /p/ + labial nasal /m/ clusters in external sandhi position and within a word in pronunciation of several Russian informants.

Above all, there is a need of examples where /pm/ would be between similar vowels in the same syllable in relation to accent.

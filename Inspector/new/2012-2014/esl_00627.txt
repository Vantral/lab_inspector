Whether academic abilities should come into account while accepting students to school is quite an interesting question.

	Most schools in Russia don't make much difference what academic abilities children have, they only care that all of them have proper level of mentality.

I can't but agree with the point of view that at the stage of primary school it is the only thing that can be observed properly, because children of such a little age can't define accurately whether they have a gift for any particular subjects.

So concerning the earlier education I support the position of disregarding academic abilities of students and letting them study all together.

They can have certain interests in some subjects, and their results also become more defined.

It can be seen whether it is easy for them to study, how long they would like to continue it and whether they are diligent pupils.

I think, at this stage both schools and students better start being more selective.

Students can choose secondary schools orienting on whether it is interesting, useful for their future and not too difficult for them to study there.

Schools can also reject students which don't have proper abilities and interests in order to improve the quality of education.

	To sum up, I think gathering students with different academic abilities in one class can be acceptable in primary school, but is quite undesirable in secondary school.

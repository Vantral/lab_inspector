One of the experiments, which I want to describe in my essay, consist of three pictures and speakers of two different languages, English and Indonesians.

   The experiment began when one of the students from Indonesia assured Boroditsky, who had some doubts about it, that Indonesians don't think and worry about time when they speak.

The experiment has shown that Indonesian choose the first two pictures, which have the same man in them, while English speakers are likely to identify the two pictures that shown the ball about to be kicked.

   Thus, the experiment have shown us that for Indonesians is more important to distinguish subject and they don't care about time, while English have many structures of tenses in their language and that's why they think about time.

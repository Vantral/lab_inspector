I'm going to compare the satisfaction levels in the US with aspects of air travel in 1999, 2000 and 2007.

To facilitate the work the data is presented in chart and table.

The chart shows us that the level of satisfaction with the job the airlines are doing has increased by 7% from the 1999 to the 2007.

We can see rapid decline in percentage of people that are dissatisfied from 32% in 1999 to 24% in 2007.

Apparently it is connected with increase in all indicators satisfaction with the specific aspects including courtesy of fly attendants (4%), courtesy of gate agents (1%), price of tickets (20%), schedules (4%) and comfort of seats.

The last point is more interesting because we haven't got any data about satisfaction with the comfort of seats, so we can believe, that comfort of seats wasn't considered as an important indicator for leading of statistics, or the percent was very low or equal to zero so we can emphasize prompt growth of the satisfaction with comfort of seats.

To conclude, I wanted to say that customer satisfaction level became considerably higher in 2007 in comparison with 1999.

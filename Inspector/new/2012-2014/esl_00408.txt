<Componential AJ0><analysis NN1><. SENT>@
	In 1950s componential analysis was for the first time used for introducing the meaning of the set of lexemes and became popular in subsequent years.

Componential analysis or lexical decomposition is a semantic method of description the sense of a lexeme into its component parts.

 Componential analysis proposes a clear-cut formalization of word's meaning description.

It is based on a compositionality principle, which claims that the meaning of a complex expression is defined by the meanings of its constituent parts and special rules used to combine them.

The word or expression is split into universal sense-components, which can construct the sense of expression in any language.

These basic elements are related by means of logical operators (negation-operator and conjunction) and several variables.

In order to illustrate the method of componential analysis in practice, consider an example :

The first lexeme "boy" consists of three sense-components, which means that the word "boy" is a human, male subject and not an adult.

The second example provides an explanation of the verb "give", which is interpreted as "x causes y to have z".

 	Componential analysis is appropriate in one application and almost useless for some other purposes, as it has both benefits and disadvantages.

For instance, colors can not be presented in terms of componential analysis, Notions of colors may be included in basic components, but they are not universal.

For example, when a woman is called a "snake" it signifies that the woman is malicious and mean.

However, the word "snake" in terms of componential analysis can not represent this sense.

	To sum it up, componential analysis is a controversial method, which is significant for computer-based aims and not appropriate for theoretical field.

The three selected representative groups are people born in Australia, new migrants born in English-speaking countries and new migrants born in other countries, which helps to diversify the information about preferences of people who belong to this culture and the information about preferences of those who do not.

The statistics show that more people born in English-speaking countries visit zoos than people born in Australia or other countries, which makes 50% on the chart compared to 35% (people born in other countries).

However, migrants from other countries, who do not like to go to the zoo, prefer to spend their free time at libraries far more than their friends born in Australia and English-speaking countries.

This makes perfect sense (if you live in the utopia), because new migrants from other countries want to study the culture and learn the language of the country they are to live in, and nothing suits this aim better that the library.

Theatres in Australia are mostly visited by migrants from English-speaking countries, possibly because the plays are close enough to their language and culture and they are still hungry for new cultural experiences, unlike their Australian friends, who have lived there for eternity and don't find local theatres as fascinating as they may find the ones in London.

There is no surprise, because going to the cinema is much cheaper than going to the theatre or to the zoo, and yet, in the view of an average person, movies are far more interesting and spectacular, than theatre plays.

The only thing that needs to be done is a good promoting company that will show young Australians that theatres can be cool too, because with the growing popularity of watching films, TV series and plays online, the disaster for the theatres is yet to come.

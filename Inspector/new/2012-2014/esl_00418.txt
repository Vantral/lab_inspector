In the scientific community the theory has been the cause of many discussions, however, the fact that componential analysis allow to describe the structural relations that define the meaning of a word was accepted by majority.

	According to the theory of componential analysis, the sense of a lexeme is the product of its components or in another point of view of itsfactors.

The relevant descriptions were demonstrated by John Lyons.

Firstly, for instance, the sense of "man" is equation with three sense-components "human", "adult"and "male", on the contrary, the sense of "woman" is combined with "human", "adult" and "female" or supposedly "non-male".

Secondly, variables are used in the theory of componential analysis in order to illustrate the directionality of structural relations and define whether one-place or two-place a relational predicate is.

For example, "father" = (x,y) PARENT & (x) MALE, that means "father" has two variables.

The sense-components illustrate the structure of the sense of a lexeme, so, it becomes possible to explain logically the diversity of words.

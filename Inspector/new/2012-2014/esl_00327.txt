Since Russian belongs to the languages where acoustic signals of the syllable boundaries are not expressed, syllabification of intervocalic consonant clusters is vague.

Experiments where native speakers split words into syllables intuitively give controversial results.

Therefore, there is a need for another more precise and objective method of data collection that would show how syllables are structured in speaker's thought.

The purpose of this course paper is to determine, how certain intervocalic consonant clusters are divided by native Russian speakers into syllables unconsciously, namely when syllable transpositions in disyllable words are applied.

These consonant groups were chosen on the basis of the contradictions that the theories and speakers' answers imply and present following clusters : [str], [ftr], [Ê¨k], [kt], [pk], [mn] and [rl].

In addition, this course paper seeks to discover correlations between the syllable boundary and the age group informants belong to, on the one side, and phonetic features of the word, such as stress position and structure of the second syllable (open or closed syllable), on the other side.

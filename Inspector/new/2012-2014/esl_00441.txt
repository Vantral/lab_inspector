Bad side of fitness center is that you spend most of time in the conditioned place and not on fresh air and you probably don't get as much fun as if you were while playing any active game.

	So if a person would like to get rid of fat and doesn't want to go to fitness center, the only way to decrease fat is to go on diet.

I personally think that the only working diet is : "If you don't want to get fat - eat less!

", while others propose the idea of special combination of (mostly) vegetables that would make you eat less while your mind would feel as if you were well-fed.

The main problem lies on self-control that you must hold over yourself to limit your ratio.

Most people became fat just because they can't control their food consumption and now we want them to even significantly reduce volumes of such consumption.

	So, if a person wants to be fit, he/she should spend some time regularly on sports, and it's more enjoyable to play an active game rather than stay in fitness center riding virtual roads on exercise bicycle.

Although, fitness centers suit more to those who like to socialize and find new friends, while if you want to play football for example you need to find another 21 men willing to play it too at the same time.

Either of these way is way more better than a diet when your body doesn't improve at all and your muscles stay as weak as they were while you were fat.

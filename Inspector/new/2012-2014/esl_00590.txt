The prediction of the whole situation is quite frustrating, that's why it's worth having a closer look to try to find some salvation for our nature.

The number of extinct plants and animals is never going to hit the point of 50 thousands per million again after it, so it's rather interesting to find out the reasons for such a stop in this disaster.

To fulfill this aim it should be balanced, which means that no text type should overwhelm the others at any given period.

The first part of the present work describes the statistics of the RNC texts ratio across decades through the general csv-table and special graphs for every text type.

The basic ground for evaluating is the comparison of Russian corpus and the Brown Corpus (The Brown University Standard Corpus of Present-Day American English) which is considered to be a standard of a well-balanced corpus.

 As the research shows considerable inconsistency between text types percentage across decades, the final aim is to invent a method of simple corpus-balancing.

It is a Python-program which takes a csv-table with periods of balancing and the perfect percentage for each one and produces a table with recommendation on adding tokens of every text type in every period.

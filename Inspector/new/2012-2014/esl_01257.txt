There is a number of reasons for it.

 Firstly, the main disadvantage of such a system is that students are interested in good marks only : they want to have high grade without putting much effort into the studies.

Professors are interested in giving good marks to students because the larger the number of students with high grades is the higher the salary a professor gets.

 Secondly, the system like that, on the one hand, is not suitable for students with Down syndrome, Cerebral palsy and other serious diseases who are not able to study with healthy ones and who need individual approach in education, and on the other hand, is not able to provide gifted students with the opportunity to further develop their potential.

Of course, if you are really outstanding, it is possible to achieve a lot being limited by standards and conventions but it does not work for the majority of students.

Besides, in this situation we are satisfied by everything surrounding us, so we have no stimulus to create something new and to achieve more then we can being limited by system's framework.

To summarize, the Government side insists on the point that educational system based on curriculum and standardized testing does not give students an opportunity to be creative, to reach a high goal, to try to go beyond some boundaries in order to discover something new.

Firstly, we should not waste a lot of time in queue, we have an opportunity just to click the bottom.

If you are busy or lazy person you do not need to go to the shopping centers, because online-shopping accepted everywhere.

In addition, as we can see, online shopping rather cheaper than traditional one.

On the other hand, some people claim, that we do not "feel the money".

Another drawback of online-shopping is that often we cannot choose the right size, or in the Internet things look batter than in reality.

It also seems to me that in the Internet we have a wide range of goods than in shops.

In conclusion, although online-shopping is a cheap and convenient way of shopping, goods in the Internet are not as excellent as we want.

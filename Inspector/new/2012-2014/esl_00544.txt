As we can see, the diagram shows what places (a zoo, a library, a theatre and a cinema) people living in Australia usually visit depending on their social position (native Australians, migrants with first English language and migrants with other first languages).

    The main aim of this research must be to compare interests of different Australian citizens and correlate it with their native language or other customs.

   This chart gives us information that the visiting zoos and theatres is poor correlated with people's language tradition, but the visiting libraries and cinemas is.

It's self-evident that people with better language skills more like watching movies, but are less interested in reading books.

   As we can see in sum up, in Australia cinemas are the most popular public places from analyzed, libraries come the second, then zoos and, finally, theatres.

I'm convinced that the main reason of such results is different difficulties of visiting these places.

For instance, there is much easier and cheaper to buy a cinema ticket, than a theatre ticket.

People cannot ask animals directly about their feelings, and it's obvious that animals can be dangerously stressed in such conditions.

For animals it is not natural to take part in such type of activities, not only can they be physically damaged by such activities, but also frustrated by hype around sport events.

Finally, in my opinion, sports involving animals change the whole concept of sports itself.

To conclude, some people think that animal sports just widen the range of activities people should be entertained by.

But, on the other hand, this whole idea of using animals for personal purposes can be dangerous for animals and our relationship with them.

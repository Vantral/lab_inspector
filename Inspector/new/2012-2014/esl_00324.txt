This differentiation depends on many criteria as the ethnic community a speaker thinks he/she belongs to and how easy it is for 'A' idiom speaker to understand 'B' idiom speaker.

According to the goal of the community, some of the criteria could be regarded as more important while the others would not deserve serious consideration.

   The importance of the objectivity was decided to be shown by example of the Republic of Mordovia.

In this republic the key factors which have defined the portrait of the nation are the general history and language, Mordvinian, and Moksha, Shoksha and Erzya idioms are considered as dialects of the Mordvinian language.

Both of them are overly focused on search for similarities or differences, thus, their descriptions of the language are one-sided.

Therefore, there is a lack of modern objective descriptions as one of the most thorough grammar dates to 1984.

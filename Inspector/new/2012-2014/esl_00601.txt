The graph and chart give information about species extinctions and the threats to plant life.

The former shows extinctions of plant and animal species from 2000 to 2100 decade.

A continuous and steady increase of extinctions from 2000 to 2060 year in the graph probably shows correlation between the cause of human impact on nature and population growth.

There is a prediction in the graph that extinctions will start to decrease in 2060 from 50000 extinctions per decade to 30000 extinctions in 2100.

Probably it will be because of noticeable lack of natural recourses which force people and governments to reconsider their attitude to plants and animals production and recovery.

The human impact is definitely more significant than natural events is.

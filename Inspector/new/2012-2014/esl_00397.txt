The current course paper analyses the data on the word forms frequency of temporal nouns (in this particular specialty, four lexemes ÑÑÑÐ¾, Ð´ÐµÐ½Ñ, Ð²ÐµÑÐµÑ, Ð½Ð¾ÑÑ) in Russia both independently and in context patterns.

The aim of the work is to check the inequality of particular word forms and to make an attempt to explain it.

The analysis demonstrated that some word forms are approximately equally used for all the concerned lexemes, and some of them, such as instrumental case are used atypically often for nouns, meanwhile other word forms are used particularly rarely (i.

However, the word form frequency differs when examined in context patterns (mostly with prepositions): words tend to be used in particular contexts with differing probability.

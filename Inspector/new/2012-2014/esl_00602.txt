The first graph predicts a rapid increase in the extinction rate of animal and plant species in tropical forests.

Massive extinction of species means not only local catastrophe, but also a worldwide tragedy of losing an enourmous life cradle.

The number of extinct plants and animals reaches 50 thousands by decade 2060, which is most likely the peak of the "conquest" - it would mean the end of land adaptation by that time.

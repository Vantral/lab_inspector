The fact that humanity has always been trying to develop itself and improve the way it lives, leads us to expected results.

One of the things that took root in our life very quickly was the Internet.

It goes without saying, that the Internet gave us many opportunities, but people also start noticing disadvantages brought by modern technologies.

It is said that we are becoming so reliant on modern technology that we forget basic skills.

I guess that the fact that we no longer use basic skills is conditioned on possibility to not use them at all.

 The Internet contains all the information we need, this huge system is taught to comply with any our request.

Thus, we have learned how to do many routine things using the Internet, so now we spend more time online.

 Modern technologies have noticeably changed our lives.

So, for me, it would not be a surprise that after a while people will forget how to do some things without clicking on the keyboard.

Nevertheless, I, personally, think that we should not accuse ourselves of such changes, because times are changing and we also do.

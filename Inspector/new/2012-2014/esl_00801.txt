Nowadays, different kinds of work people can do outside their workplace and this is a big revolution in a business field.

In my opinion, the main plus of information technologies is that people shouldn't work in an office.

Of course, not every kind of work can be done at home.

For example, workers of a big engineering plant can't make new cars at home, but people, that work with people, with documentation can easily now keep all information about clients and securities on computer.

It can help to save a lot of time and rise up the productivity of workers.

 Another benefit of it is that people can work with their families, which have a good influence on their efficiency.

I suppose, that such kind of work reduce stressful situations, conflicts with the staff.

On the other hand, technological development demands higher skilled workers and it can be a big problem for employers.

Second drawback is that the health can really suffer from such kind of work.

A person who spends much time on their computers and can notice, that the level of health becomes lower.

To sum up, it is hard to find considerable disadvantages of working at home, but, as any other new style of life, it has many followers and opponents.

In my view, information technologies became a part of our life, so we should let them try to lighten our work and save more free time for ourselves.

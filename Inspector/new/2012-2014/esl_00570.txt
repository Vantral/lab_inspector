The data is presented in bar charts that show three main aspects : age of people, status of their weight and distribution of them in percents based on their 'weight status'.

In 1950, the group of people having ideal weight within all age groups remained dominate and stagnated.

Meanwhile the group of those having obesity was the smallest and only appeared among people whose age varies between 40 and 69.

Nevertheless, the figures change, and the least stable group is of those who have underweight.

The amounf of people having overweight is decreasing as people become older.

Still youngsters have the biggest amounf of those who have ideal weight, and again amount of people having obesity increases as they become older.

The most unstable is the parameter of overweight, and people with underweight are of the smallest number.

 Overall, major changes are noticed in the second graph while in the first figures don't change so dramatically.

The sutiation has changed much within 60 years, so now we can tell that our anscestors had more stable weight during the life while our contemporaries undergo with some changes as they become older.

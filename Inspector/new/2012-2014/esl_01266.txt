The experiment guided by Lera Borodiski, an American psycholinguist, revealed that native speakers of different languages have completely different associative links.

According to the theory of Whorf and Sapir our worldview, our perception and way of thinking are determined by the structure of our native language.

 Consequently Indonesian, who associated pictures with the same person of them in general seem to be more opened and hospital, they seem to pay more attention to people around them, to their characters, to their personal particularities, to their emotions.

 English on the contrary chose two images picturing the same action are likely to attach more importance to what other people do, to what's happening around them.

Considering the human aspect of the "Indonesian" way of thinking I can also suppose that native Indonesian speakers are more emotional themselves, than English, who are in fact more restrained and discreet, who respect their and other's personal space, who pay more attention to actions and events.

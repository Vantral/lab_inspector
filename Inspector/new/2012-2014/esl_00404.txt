For "A study of language phonetic variation in Russian language" course project motivation comes from the fact that in the last fifty years a few was done to develop this field of research, there is no data provided that could explain the reasons of appearance of this phenomenon and show in which occurrences which variants are used .

The purpose of this work is to explain a vowel variation ("a" or "Ñ") after a hushing by sociolinguistics methods.

The other aim is to find out how this kind of variation depends on such social factors as education, social status and age.

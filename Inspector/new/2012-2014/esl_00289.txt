Abstract
<Abstract AJ0>@
Despite the existence of several dictionaries of Russian synonyms, there is still no such dictionary that would be representative, informative, and easy to use at the same time; existing dictionaries do not pass all the criteria for different reasons.

The present work is an attempt to create a pilot version of a dictionary of that kind.

To achieve this aim, each of us took several synonymic rows form Alexandrova's dictionary, and described common meaning and common complementary for all synonyms in each row, and special meaning, special complementary, government, for each synonym in each row; every synonym is also illustrated with examples of their usage.

To make our dictionary easier to use, we designed it as a computer database, with an access from the special website.

This website is built on PHP programming language, and synonymic rows are stored in SQL-tables.

The current result of our work is an online dictionary of synonyms, which contains 35 synonymic rows.

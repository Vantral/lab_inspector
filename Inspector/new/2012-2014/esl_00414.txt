Componential analysis, also called lexical decomposition, is a method of meaning's description, which involves the dissection of the sense of a lexeme into its componential parts and distinctly illustrates sense relations in the word.

Componential analysis was considered a significant invention owing to its ability to exhibit the inner structure of words with logical expressions.

The notion of competential analysis has long been part of linguistics researches, however the method was regarded ineffective as a consequence of uncovered shortcomings.

	In my opinion, the convenience of componential analysis is a comparatively arguable issue.

Componential analysis provides ample opportunities in the field of machine translation and semantic annotation due to its capacity to decompose lexemes into basic sense components.

This quality offers the challenge of simplifying operations with the sentence's structure and the opportunity to generate programmes for superior comprehension of human speech.

Nevertheless, componential analysis has a considerable number of theoretical flaws related to its incapability to establish the fixed list of elementary sense components and define sense components of certain lexemes, which meanings can be interpreted in dissimilar ways.

The specific instances of flaws are presented below.
<The AT0><specific AJ0><instances NN2><of PRF><flaws NN2><are VBB><presented VVN><below AV0><. SENT>@
	First of all, it is impractible to distinguish parts of speech within the bounds of componential analysis.
<First ORD><of PRF><all DT0><, PUN><it PNP><is VBZ><impractible AJ0><to TO0><distinguish VVI><parts NN2><of PRF><speech NN1><within PRP><the AT0><bounds NN2><of PRF><componential AJ0><analysis NN1><. SENT>@
The description of the word consists of sense components, which do not clarify the part of speech.

For instance, there is no difference in the structure of sense components of the word "quick" and "quickly".
<For PRP><instance NN1><, PUN><there EX0><is VBZ><no AT0><difference NN1><in PRP><the AT0><structure NN1><of PRF><sense NN1><components NN2><of PRF><the AT0><word NN1><" PUQ><quick AJ0><" PUQ><and CJC><" PUQ><quickly AV0><" PUQ><. SENT>@
The second weak point of componential analysis is the interpretation of colours.
<The AT0><second ORD><weak AJ0><point NN1><of PRF><componential AJ0><analysis NN1><is VBZ><the AT0><interpretation NN1><of PRF><colours NN2><. SENT>@
Obviously, "red", "green" and "blue" should be included in the list of elementary sense components.
<Obviously AV0><, PUN><" PUQ><red AJ0><" PUQ><, PUN><" PUQ><green AJ0><" PUQ><and CJC><" PUQ><blue AJ0><" PUQ><should VM0><be VBI><included VVN><in PRP><the AT0><list NN1><of PRF><elementary AJ0><sense NN1><components NN2><. SENT>@
However, it is incomprehensible how to elucidate such colours as "terra-cotta" or "scarlet".
<However AV0><, PUN><it PNP><is VBZ><incomprehensible AJ0><how AVQ><to TO0><elucidate VVI><such DT0><colours NN2><as CJS><" PUQ><terra-cotta NN1><" PUQ><or CJC><" PUQ><scarlet AJ0><" PUQ><. SENT>@
There are two ways of decision this problem : either every colour should be included in the list of elementary sense components or all colours should be elucidated in RGB.
<There EX0><are VBB><two CRD><ways NN2><of PRF><decision NN1><this DT0><problem NN1><: PUN><either AV0><every AT0><colour NN1><should VM0><be VBI><included VVN><in PRP><the AT0><list NN1><of PRF><elementary AJ0><sense NN1><components NN2><or CJC><all DT0><colours NN2><should VM0><be VBI><elucidated VVN><in PRP><RGB NP0><.

 Furthermore, the considerable amount of words can only be described relatively.
<Furthermore AV0><, PUN><the AT0><considerable AJ0><amount NN1><of PRF><words NN2><can VM0><only AV0><be VBI><described VVN><relatively AV0><. SENT>@
For example, it is problematic to give an explanation of the word "tasty", as every person's tastes are dissimilar.
<For PRP><example NN1><, PUN><it PNP><is VBZ><problematic AJ0><to TO0><give VVI><an AT0><explanation NN1><of PRF><the AT0><word NN1><" PUQ><tasty AJ0><" PUQ><, PUN><as CJS><every AT0><person NN1><'s POS><tastes NN2><are VBB><dissimilar AJ0><. SENT>@
Another example is the absence of strict boundary in the words "baby", "child", "adult" and "old man".

These definitions depend on the appearance and temper, the century and, ultimately, perception of speaker.

	In other words, componential analysis can be used as a helpful tool in computer linguistics, especially machine translation, and semantic annotation.

However, this method has a considerable amount of theoretical flaws which prevented it from extensive usage in linguistics.

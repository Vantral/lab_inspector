Three Men in a Boat as a humorous adventure story is considered to be closely connected with old traditions of humorous travel writing and frequently compared with works of Mark Twain and Charles Dickenson.

With the book written in 1889, the plot of the story takes place at the same time - at the end of the 19th century, telling us about three Londoners, gentlemen and chums (and the dog, of course) - Jay (Jerome K.

It is curious that Jay's friends in the book had prototypes in real life - they were friends of the writer.

Jerome's time could be : in the setting of the plot absent-minded, lazy and with no ambitions they sit in Jay's apartment and discuss illnesses they suffer from and ones they yet haven't experienced, smoking cigars and complaining about how bad they feel.

Nevertheless, from the first pages you can see that Jay has got a bit more responsibility than his friends, and has a tendency to reflect.

Therefore the narrator ironically laughs at his own and his friends' mistakes and weaknesses - it is important to notice that he assumes their own weaknesses, but does not deny them, as well as he does not deny that he behaves just like his friends do.

Being planned to be written as a travel report, in this story friends, after long negotiating, decide to set off for a river trip from Kingston to Oxford to relax and take off the routine strain.

As it was supposed to be, they meet difficulties and become victims of simple circumstances of life - getting in the rain in a beautiful suit, or hurting a finger while hammering in a nail.

The author puts it mildly with a bit of laughter that these three gentlemen, although they are old enough, are not adapted to modern life and they often take wrong decisions - just as spoilt children.

But even considering ridiculous and sometimes idiotic actions of this trio, I fell in love with them and did not wish to stop reading the book.

There is also something that irrevocably has won my feelings - the taste, with which the book is written.

One little thing, about which I may complain - sometimes funny Jay's stories that attenuate gents' travelling routine may seem a bit too long and detailed.

It is possible that it was the idea of the author - details may be adding more ridiculousness to these stories.

Nevertheless, I would say that these stories could be told in a shorter way.

Not because the book didn't manage with its destination - I believe it made people think a bit and makes them do it now - but because people and times change, while the problems of the society stay.

A significant amount of typological studies are devoted to subject-verb-object positioning and morphosyntactic alignment (like distinction between nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive languages).

Therefore, there is a need for more particular and objective research that would provide the basis for revealing universals, regularities and patterns.

The purpose of this course paper is to assemble and to analyse all attributes of volitional moods in Northwest Caucasian languages.

In order to find out ways of expression of volitional moods, this study was based on grammar books and data from Abaza, Abkhaz, Adyghe, Kabardian and Ubykh.

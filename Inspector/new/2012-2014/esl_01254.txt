A large number of flights can provide people with an opportunity to move from one continent to another almost every time they want to.

 The greatest benefit is that low-cost airlines sell cheap tickets, which make them affordable for many people.

Another point in favour of low-cost companies is that they provide their passengers with choice whether to eat on board or not.

In many cases the flight is really short so not everybody needs this service.

The time of their departures and arrivals is often uncomfortable, for instance, in the midnight.

What is more, passengers must check in for their flight online otherwise they will have to pay extra money (often even more than they have paid for the ticket).

Another drawback to cheap flights is that people often use them even if they do not really need to.

In many cases it is possible to go somewhere by train, which is much greener means of transport.

 To sum up, the impact of introducing low-cost airlines was huge and it managed to make a revolution in the field of travelling.

All in all, I strongly believe that the advantages of low-cost airlines outweigh the disadvantages.

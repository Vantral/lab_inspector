The increase in a number of cases of plagiarism made plagiarism detection both in natural and artificial language a fast developing field.

For instance, in spite of the variety of systems which detect cases of plagiarism in program's source code, there is no program which can work with short pieces of code, such as basic-level programming homework.

The goal of this course paper is to create a system which is able to find plagiarism in the students of linguistics' homework.

The task of the paper is to develop methods of plagiarism detection which are specific for short programs fulfilling similar tasks, which can subsequently be a theoretical basis for the system.

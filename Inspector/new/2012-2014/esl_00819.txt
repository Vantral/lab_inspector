These two charts display the factors which cause the changes of wildlife population and the species which have mostly experienced these changes.

From the first chart one can conclude that habitat destruction plays a crucial role : nearly half of all the changes were caused by it.

At the second place is the factor of pollution; overexploitation and random factors play almost equal roles (they resulted in 15% and 12% of changes correspondingly), while different diseases and introduction of exotic species did not make so severe impact.

Concerning the second chart, a serious decline of insect and freshwater fish population can be observed (for instance, -42% for butterflies).

The situation is better with birds and reptiles, as well as with mammals and aquatic mammals (-6% for owls and +23% for bats).

To conclude, the situation is obviously deplorable and disharmonious : even though the number of some species increased, the population of others declined crucially, and the most frequent reason of these changes is human activity.

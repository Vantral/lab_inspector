In the beginning I would like to explain these points of view.

The second point consists on the point that the sport where animals take part is an important part of our lifestyle.

People who adhere to this position use the fact that we, humans, has always used animal for our entertainment.

Also they say that there is no reason to worry about because people who work in the place where animals are kept assure us that they take care for the animals as much as they can.

Well, it is time now to explain my point of view.

Facts say that animals are contained in the terrible conditions.

The animals are usually bullied, they are beaten, and people do not feed them enough.

There are a lot of movies which show us the violence with which people turn to the animals (for example, earthlings).

I think that the second point was made to show people's ignorance and hypocrisy.

So, answering the topic's question, I am sure that sports involving animals should be banned as fast as it is possible.

The distinctions between homonymy and polysemy have been revealed by semanticists for many years, yet the traditional approach lacks clarity and cannot predict which types of homonymy can result in ambiguity and which cannot.

In his well-known textbook Linguistic Semantics in the chapter Homonymy and Polysemy : Lexical and Grammatical Ambiguity, John Lyons starts off by demonstrating that the traditional definition of homonyms as different words with the same form, is vague.
<In PRP><his DPS><well-known AJ0><textbook NN1><Linguistic AJ0><Semantics NN1><in PRP><the AT0><chapter NN1><Homonymy NN1><and CJC><Polysemy NN1><: PUN><Lexical AJ0><and CJC><Grammatical AJ0><Ambiguity NN1><, PUN><John NP0><Lyons NP0><starts VVZ><off AVP><by PRP><demonstrating VVG><that CJT><the AT0><traditional AJ0><definition NN1><of PRF><homonyms NN2><as PRP><different AJ0><words NN2><with PRP><the AT0><same DT0><form NN1><, PUN><is VBZ><vague AJ0><.

Instead, he offers to substitute 'lexeme' for 'word' but still considers this definition as defective.
<Instead AV0><, PUN><he PNP><offers VVZ><to TO0><substitute VVI><' PUQ><lexeme NN1><' PUQ><for PRP><' PUQ><word NN1><' PUQ><but CJC><still AV0><considers VVZ><this DT0><definition NN1><as CJS><defective AJ0><. SENT>@
 In the next paragraph the author provides the definition of absolute homonymy, conditional on three criteria : whether all the forms are 1) unrelated in meaning, 2) identical and 3) grammatically equivalent.
<In PRP><the AT0><next ORD><paragraph NN1><the AT0><author NN1><provides VVZ><the AT0><definition NN1><of PRF><absolute AJ0><homonymy NN1><, PUN><conditional AJ0><on PRP><three CRD><criteria NN2><: PUN><whether CJS><all DT0><the AT0><forms NN2><are VBB><1 CRD><) PUR><unrelated AJ0><in PRP><meaning NN1><, PUN><2 CRD><) PUR><identical AJ0><and CJC><3 CRD><) PUR><grammatically AV0><equivalent AJ0><.

Then he establishes a notion of partial homonymy, which is illustrated, for example, by the verbs 'find' and 'found'.
<Then AV0><he PNP><establishes VVZ><a AT0><notion NN1><of PRF><partial AJ0><homonymy NN1><, PUN><which DTQ><is VBZ><illustrated VVN><, PUN><for PRP><example NN1><, PUN><by PRP><the AT0><verbs NN2><' POS><find NN1><' PUQ><and CJC><' PUQ><found VVN><' PUQ><. SENT>@
These verbs share the same form, which satisfies the first criterion of partial homonymy about identity of minimally one form.
<These DT0><verbs NN2><share VVB><the AT0><same DT0><form NN1><, PUN><which DTQ><satisfies VVZ><the AT0><first ORD><criterion NN1><of PRF><partial AJ0><homonymy NN1><about PRP><identity NN1><of PRF><minimally AV0><one CRD><form NN1><. SENT>@
 The second criterion states that only one or two criteria of absolute homonymy must be satisfied, and is not also violated in the above example where the forms of the verbs are not grammatically equivalent to each other.
<The AT0><second ORD><criterion NN1><states VVZ><that CJT><only AV0><one CRD><or CJC><two CRD><criteria NN2><of PRF><absolute AJ0><homonymy NN1><must VM0><be VBI><satisfied AJ0><, PUN><and CJC><is VBZ><not XX0><also AV0><violated VVN><in PRP><the AT0><above AJ0><example NN1><where AVQ><the AT0><forms NN2><of PRF><the AT0><verbs NN2><are VBB><not XX0><grammatically AV0><equivalent AJ0><to PRP><each DT0><other NN1><.

In the following paragraphs, Lyons deals with the problem of lexical and grammatical ambiguity, which occurs, for instance, in the sentence 'They found hospitals and charitable institutions'.
<In PRP><the AT0><following AJ0><paragraphs NN2><, PUN><Lyons NP0><deals VVZ><with PRP><the AT0><problem NN1><of PRF><lexical AJ0><and CJC><grammatical AJ0><ambiguity NN1><, PUN><which DTQ><occurs VVZ><, PUN><for PRP><instance NN1><, PUN><in PRP><the AT0><sentence NN1><' POS><They PNP><found VVD><hospitals NN2><and CJC><charitable AJ0><institutions NN2><' POS><.

Both verbs 'find' and 'found' can take a noun-phrase 'hospitals and charitable institutions' as their direct object, and both have the form 'found'.
<Both DT0><verbs NN2><' POS><find NN1><' PUQ><and CJC><' PUQ><found VVN><' PUQ><can VM0><take VVI><a AT0><noun-phrase NN1><' POS><hospitals NN2><and CJC><charitable AJ0><institutions NN2><' POS><as PRP><their DPS><direct AJ0><object NN1><, PUN><and CJC><both AV0><have VHB><the AT0><form NN1><' PUQ><found VVN><' PUQ><.

If the form 'have' is put before the form 'found', the ambiguity is eliminated.
<If CJS><the AT0><form NN1><' POS><have VHB><' PUQ><is VBZ><put VVN><before PRP><the AT0><form NN1><' PUQ><found VVN><' PUQ><, PUN><the AT0><ambiguity NN1><is VBZ><eliminated VVN><. SENT>@
However, the author affirms that ambiguity, which results from absolute homonymy, cannot disappear after the grammatical environment of the sentence has been changed.
<However AV0><, PUN><the AT0><author NN1><affirms VVZ><that DT0><ambiguity NN1><, PUN><which DTQ><results VVZ><from PRP><absolute AJ0><homonymy NN1><, PUN><cannot NP0><disappear VVB><after PRP><the AT0><grammatical AJ0><environment NN1><of PRF><the AT0><sentence NN1><has VHZ><been VBN><changed VVN><.

Lyons continues by stating that the traditional definition of polysemy as a property of single lexemes, makes the difference between homonymy and polysemy imprecise, and offers two criteria : 1) etymology and 2) relatedness of meaning.
<Lyons NP0><continues VVZ><by PRP><stating VVG><that CJT><the AT0><traditional AJ0><definition NN1><of PRF><polysemy NN1><as PRP><a AT0><property NN1><of PRF><single AJ0><lexemes NN2><, PUN><makes VVZ><the AT0><difference NN1><between PRP><homonymy NN1><and CJC><polysemy NN1><imprecise AJ0><, PUN><and CJC><offers VVZ><two CRD><criteria NN2><: PUN><1 CRD><) PUR><etymology NN1><and CJC><2 CRD><) PUR><relatedness NN1><of PRF><meaning NN1><.

However, Lyons highlights examples in which semantically unrelated words like 'sole1' ("bottom of foot or shoe") and 'sole'2 ("kind of fish") have the same origins, and the converse situations also exist.
<However AV0><, PUN><Lyons NP0><highlights VVZ><examples NN2><in PRP><which DTQ><semantically AV0><unrelated AJ0><words NN2><like PRP><' PUQ><sole1 NN1><' PUQ><( PUL><" PUQ><bottom NN1><of PRF><foot NN1><or CJC><shoe NN1><" PUQ><) PUR><and CJC><' POS><sole'2 NN1><( PUL><" PUQ><kind NN1><of PRF><fish NN0><" PUQ><) PUR><have VHB><the AT0><same DT0><origins NN2><, PUN><and CJC><the AT0><converse NN1><situations NN2><also AV0><exist VVB><.

In order to explain such cases, the author claims that what is considered historically as homonymy might be reinterpreted by later generations of speakers as polysemy.

Leaving aside the fact that Lyons has described such complicated terms of homonymy and polysemy in an accessible way even to a non-specialist, there are several criticisms, which can be levelled at his work.
<Leaving VVG><aside AV0><the AT0><fact NN1><that CJT><Lyons NP0><has VHZ><described VVN><such DT0><complicated AJ0><terms NN2><of PRF><homonymy NN1><and CJC><polysemy NN1><in PRP><an AT0><accessible AJ0><way NN1><even AV0><to PRP><a AT0><non-specialist NN1><, PUN><there EX0><are VBB><several DT0><criticisms NN2><, PUN><which DTQ><can VM0><be VBI><levelled VVN><at PRP><his DPS><work NN1><.

First, it is still not obvious which of the criteria is more relevant - etymological or semantic.

For example, the Russian word 'ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ°' has at least two meanings : 1) "a tool used for cutting crops such as grass or corn"; 2) "a hairdo formed by braiding or twisting the hair".

Both meanings have semantic affinity but they differentiate in etymology, which means that this case cannot be related neither to homonymy, nor to polysemy.

 In addition, the semantic criterion appears to be ambiguous and the article would have benefited if the author had explained how to define relatedness in words' meaning.

 Finally, Lyons description of homonymy and polysemy could have been more detailed if he had included the information about the universality of criteria in other languages.

Despite the above criticisms, Lyons has provided a complete description of homonymy and polysemy having highlighted the general notions which are essential for the firsthand view of this area.

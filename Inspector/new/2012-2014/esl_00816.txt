The bar chart presented bellow give information about changes in number of certain wildlife species such as freshwater fishes, birds, reptiles, insects, mammals and aquatic mammals.

The pie chart states the causes of changes in wildlife population amid which there are such factors as pollution, overexploitation, disease, introduction of exotic species, habitat destruction and random factors, for instance accidents.

As for the factors, the highest percentage is presented by the human invasion in the wildlife : overexploitation - 15%, pollution - 21% and habitat destruction - 43%; other factors that involve minimal human impact or do not involve it at all in sum total 21%.

Thus the principal culprits for the crucial decrease of insect population (50%) must be habitat destruction owing to the widening territory of megapolises and pollution due to chemical contamination of the places that are still not occupied by cities.

These two factors are also responsible for the decrease in number of birds, reptiles and hedgehogs since these species are not of hunters' interest.

The case of population decrease of freshwater fishes (30% approximately) and water voles (3%) introduce another side of human invasion - overexploitation as fish and fur are widely consumed by the society.

In conclusion it should be mentioned that by reducing the amount of impact put on the nature we can save comparatively great number of wildlife species.

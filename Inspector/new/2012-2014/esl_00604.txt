The graph and chart give us inside in the ecological situation, that is connected to the plant and animal life.

They display prognosis of extinction for the next hundred years and threats to plant life, that could explain the dependence between these two.

The graph shows that up to the year 2060 the extinction level grows constantly, reaching 50,000 extinctions per million species per decade.

According to the chart, the main reason of the plant extinction is human impact on the nature, being four times as high as the damage caused by natural events.

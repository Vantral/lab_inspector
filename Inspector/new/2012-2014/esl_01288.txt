I hardly imagine the reasoning that leaded to this conclusion.

It's unlikely that it based on some historical sources : the oldest pieces of art not the architectural construction at all; the first petroglyphs and jewelry are much older, that all the buildings known to modern people.

We can't also say that the architecture is a mother of art in the same meaning that math is the tsaritsa of science.

In other words it is not true that the methods of architecture are universal and necessary for all other arts, and it's the architecture, which designs these methods.

It seems to me, that the only thing, which makes the architecture similar to all arts without exception (even non-visual arts as music and literature) is the importance of composition, proportionality of work's elements.

But I don't think that the composition is an architectural know-how.

But the architecture has the trait, which permits us to call it with some reservations "mother or arts".

Thanks to it artists can study at previous ages' architects much easier than at the poets or painters.

Their art ruins, no traces will remain of canvases and books, but the architecture stands for ages.

However this function is also shared by the architecture and the sculpture.

So, on my opinion it's possible to say that the architecture (and the sculpture) is the annals of art, but I see no reason to call the architecture the mother of art.

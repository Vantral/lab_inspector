According to the way of acquiring the language, there are different types of the speakers : the native speakers, the heritage speakers (the migrants whose mother tongue was affected by the language of the other country) and the language learners.

It is important to study mistakes because they are the source of knowledge on the mechanisms language works in brain.

 The research on heritage mistakes has already been done by linguists such as M.

The purpose of the course paper as a part of the heritage project is to classify comparative constructions in heritage texts from the Corpus of Heritage Russian, to investigate what types of these constructions are the most complicated to use for the heritage speakers and to understand what parts of the constructions are particularly prone to be affected by mistakes.

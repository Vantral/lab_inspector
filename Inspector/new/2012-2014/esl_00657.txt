The most striking feature is that the number of graduates increased for both male and female students.

However, the overall rise in numbers was not always steady.

The most dramatic reduction in the number of students, no matter male or female, was in 1998.

It was on around 5000 lower than the number of graduates was 3 years earlier.

In other words, the amount of students who gratuated in 1998 was the same than was in the very begining in 1992.

As can also be seen from the chart, much more women than men gratuated between 1992 and 2007.

Moreover, this number had been increased more rapidly than men's one since 2000 till 2007.

To sum up, more people were with education than it used to be in 1992.

Although surprisingly, more students, who are educated, are women.

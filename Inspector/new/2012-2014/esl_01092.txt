Some people affirm that good comunicators are born and not made, the others don't share this point of view.

As I see it, good comunicators can only be made because people learn to understand each other in process of interaction.

Undoubtedly some people are born much more predisposed to be good at communicating, they are more confident, charismatic, often good leaders, are able to get along with people.

It's enough to be patient and diligent.

Moreover it is impossible to become a good communicator without any efforts for the reason that every ability needs to be maintained and developped.

On the whole in my opinion the only way to be good at communication is to interact with people, to study their behaviour and try to become confident and attractive.

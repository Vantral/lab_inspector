Many people believe that the most effective way is to increase prison sentences; others claim there are better alternatives.

From my perspective, I would rather agree with the second group.

On the one hand, making criminals sitting in cells for a longer time might have its benefits.

Firstly, people may become more afraid of such serious consequences of their illigal activity.

This fact may become a strong remedy for the problem.

Moreover, this new rule might reduce the repetetive crimes because it is highly unlikely for people who have spend enormous amount of time in prison to make crimes again.

On the other hand, I beleive it is more effective to eleminate the problem from its root.

First of all, due to better education and proper life circumstances the amount of criminals will decline.

Schools should develop such qualities as high morality and humanity in children which may result in their future lifeviews.

So people with such views will not be able to commit a crime because of them.

Good economics and level of life will also reduce the need of making crimes.

Secondly, I beleive government should develop high level of citizen consiousness in people, what also may affect positevely on a discussed problem.

In conclusion, I would say that longer prison sentences, benefical as they are, will not be the best solution to high level of criminality.

It is more effective to develop inner consiousness and provide people with proper education and means to live honestly.

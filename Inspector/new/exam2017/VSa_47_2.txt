First of all, the people who claims on disqualification of the athletes who was caught on using drugs break down the spirit of honest and clear competition.

It is difficult for some people to accept such point of view that is why they argued that we can not forbide athletes who used illegal drugs to take part in professional competitions forever because it is their profession and we can not let them live without job for the rest of their life because of the one mistake.

But such opponents do not take in mind the fact that some illegal drugs lead to unacceptable changes in the athlet's body and that is why they can not be judged like the other who do not use illegal drug's.

It is clear for me that people who think that athlets should not be banned forever can not be absolutely right because sport means honesty and true spirit of competition.

In conclusion it is better to say that sport is such kind of human activity that do not accept any kind of lie and cheating.

So, illegal drugs should be banned and the sportmen who was caught on taking them also should be disqualified.

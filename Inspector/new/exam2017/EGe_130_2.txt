To solve this problem, I would like to suggest government to create some social programs which would be held at schools and universities where children would be taught how to behave in society and would be given a law education of the country where they live.

In conclusion, I would like to say that we need to look after our young generation in a proper way because they are considered to be our future and we need to give them the model of how to behave in the society and then the situation with commiting crimes will change a lot in the near future.

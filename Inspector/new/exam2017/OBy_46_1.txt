 By looking at the charts we can also tell that it is more convenient to transport metal by rail than by road because it makes up 35% of goods transported in the first chart and a mere 11% in the second, whereas for things like food products and non-metallic minerals transportation by road is on contrast, almost popular means - 30% against 11% of rail transportation in the first case and 13% against about 5% of rail transportation.

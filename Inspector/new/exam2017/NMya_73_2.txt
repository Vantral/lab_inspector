I disagree with it and in this essay I will explain why buying the original discs is not a good alternative and why the music and film idustries need to concentrate on the free trade.

Firstly, the amount of money that musicians and producers receive depends most of all on the amount of people who will perceive their content.

Most of people do not want to spend their money on such things and if the only way for them would be to buy the song or movie, they could refuse to do that.

So, the producers will lose half of their audience and as a result receive less money.

As an example of the dependence between audience and producer's money, we can take the situation when the creators of the movie spend a lot of money to make it, and when the movie is released and becomes not so popular among people, the directors and producers receive less money then they have spent.

So paying for the original discs is not in the interest of the creators of them, first of all.

So, the strict rules and sanctions would lead just to another ways of looking for free materials, that could even harder to control.

Like in Russia we have a lot of free websites to watch the movies, and th companies make money from the advertisment that shows while you're watching something for free.

All in all, in my opinion, there are many ways for film and music producers to gain money and people shouldn't pay for the songs and movies, when they are doing at home and not going to the cinema or concert.

My position is that it is normal to download some films or music; which are rare, but in fact, nowadays almost nobody buy discs, because they are litle 'acient goods'.

On the one hand we understand that art provides lose money when people downloading and sharing music or films instead of going to the cinema.

That is an issue in the movie and music industry, but in real life many of people just have not an opportunity to visit a cinema so often or buy huge amount of music.

 To conclude my thoughts I guess that buying the original version of movies and music must be decided individually by ourselves.

Someone need better quality of a sound and a picture so that he or she could buy the originals, but who just need a first-hand acquaintance with smth can get it illegally and I suppose that it shouldn't be punished.

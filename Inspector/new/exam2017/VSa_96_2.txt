Some people believe that there is no need for a very strict punishment for it : the sportsmen should not be allowed to compete for 2 years.

For example, somebody can be too young to understand he is doing a wrong way using the illegal drugs, but after a ban for 2 years he will understand that he should not do such things.

The second opinion is that the cheating in professional sports is cruel and it should be punished very strong.

As for me, I totally agree with the first opinion.

However the use of illegal drugs in athletics is awful, it is just a mistake that can be forgotten if the athlete does not breaks the law anymore.

To conclude, the athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned for sure, but they need the chance to make their reputaton good again after the punishment period.

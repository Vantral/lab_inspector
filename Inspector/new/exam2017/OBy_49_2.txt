So, some people have big problem with health, because they don't know how to right connected with technology.

In my opinion, people should control amount of time which they spend with technology, because, for example, more my friends have problems with eyes.

I think, that if they had spent their time on the nature or with really books, not computer, they would have had better health.

First of all, people should create plan or limists for technology and after that they can use tat or technology will dangerous for them, on the one hand.

So, I think that technology is a good way to do something important for our work, for our develop and knowledge about the world.

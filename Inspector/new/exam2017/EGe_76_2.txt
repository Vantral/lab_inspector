Moreover, as for working with the teenagers who have already committed crimes meetings with prisoners can be arranged, who will tell these young children how they really regret doing that.

In conclusion, I would like to say that it is highly important to show young children the consiquencies of committing crimes, to make them realise that it is not an easy way of getting money.

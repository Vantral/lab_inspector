One of the issues, discussed nowadays, is the spreading of pirate copies of music and films on the internet.

On the one hand, enormous amounts of money are not only spent by musicians and film producers on making media product, but also lost from pirate copying.

In other words, media-makers don't get as much money as they deserve for selling their product, but also suffer high costs of production.

These costs should be at least partly covered by the price paid by consumers.

That means, that quantity and quality of media products would reduce if only rich media-producers could afford to create unit of media.

For this reason, it is better to punish people, who share and download pirate copies.

On the other hand, media-makers make a lot of money for presentation of their media-products at a public places (like concerts, cinemas etc).

People, especially young one, need an access to free media products in order to discover the world, life and their personality.

To conclude, I consider that pirate copying should not be punished, as cultural development f the society must be in priority before some amount of money lost by another media producer.

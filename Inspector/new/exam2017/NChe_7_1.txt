The difference in transporting machinery is even more significant : the percentage of machinery transported by road is six times less than the same metric in the case of transportation by rail.

On the contrary, producers of non-metallic minerals and food products tend to use roads when they want to transport their goods.

To sum up, producers of food products and non-metallic minerals pefer to choose transportation by road, while producers of metals and machinery are more likely to use rail to transport their goods.

Firstly, English is an international language and, talking about foreign films, people in many countries can watch films in English, but not in Chinese or in Russian.

Secondly, I do not really know what is wrong with filmaking in my country, but it is more likely to find great and deep American or British film than Russian one.

If some Russian film is really good, that is always because of the plot and some message, not because of visual effects.

Although, I do not think that the matter is in financial support.

Many Russian films had great support from government, and that didn't help at all.

Sometimes people who make films in Russia just take these money from government for their own needs, and their films appear to be awful.

What about financial support, there should be fair competition for getting it, and in this case it can be useful.

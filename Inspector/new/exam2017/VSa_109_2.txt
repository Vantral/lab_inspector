There are two approaches to its elimination : banning a sportsman from competition for a certain period or forever.

To my mind, we should stick to the temporary ban.

I think that terminal banning could be used as a tool to put aside certain athletes regardless of whether they were caught on using drugs or not.

Therefore, it is a threat to the core rules of fair-play.

Those in favour of the terminal ban might say that a sportsmen caught taking drugs once are bound to do it again.

I cannot but agree that there is some sense in such a statement but we are living in a media world, so drug usage conflicts are always discussed and an athlete is exposed to it.

It results in collapsing of his reputation and having to win the society's trust back be behaving.

Moreover, it just seems to me that we must not put a stigma on anyone and try to give them another chance instead.

To sum up, I stand for a temporary ban.

Though, it may seem like a half-measure, it will not be one if accompanied by more fair and open drug tests

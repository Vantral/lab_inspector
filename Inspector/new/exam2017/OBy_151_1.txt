The graph represents information about minimum and maximum temperature level during the year in two different citys : Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro.

 The most striking feature is that average temperature in Yakutsk has sharp maximum while one in Rio de Janeiro remains approximately between close values during the period.

During the first six months both maximum and minimum average temperature in Yakutsk roket from -35*C and -41*C to about 26*C and 13*C at the beginning of July, riching their maximum.

By contrast, in the Brazil city those temperatures decrease over this period, however not so significantly from 30*C and 27*C to 25*C and 17*C respectively for maximum and minimum opposite.

Yakutsk's temperatures fall again to their beginning values, whilst Rio de Janeiro's one increase and also recover their values.

 It is clear that temperature fluctuation during the year in Yakutsk is bigger and has sharper form in comparison with Rio de Janeiro's values.

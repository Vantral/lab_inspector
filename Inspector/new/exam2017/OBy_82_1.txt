 As we can see, the main product to be transported by rail are metals, they take more than a third of the whole count.

At the same time there are three times less metals transported by roads.

Manufactured goods and food products are the main cargo for the road transportations, differing only in two percent in favour of foods.

While quantity of manufactured goods is almost the same on railroads as it is on roads, 25 and 28 percent respectively, road transport carries almost thrice as much food products.

 Non-metallic minerals take the last place in railroad cargo, counting only 6 percent and the road transport carries twice as much.

Also, while machinery takes 12 percent of rails total it's being transported only by 2 percent of the road machines, working the last place in their chart.

Some consider that athletes who use drugs should not take part in competitions for two years, whereas others are sure that atheletes schould not be able to compete for the rest of their lives.

People who think that atheletes should be banned from competitions for a limited period (eg 2 years) are more kind.

But many atheletes use it even at the period of disqualification and life does not teach them.

However, many atheletes also understand their mistakes and after the incompete periods start new lives without using drugs.

However, there are also people who suggest that atheletes who use drugs should not be able to compete professionally for the rest of their lives.

Such position is rather radical because there are many great sportsmen who were disqualificated and after it start a new great career.

There are also sportsmen who use illegal drugs even without knowing that such drugs can not be used.

As for me, I suggest that we all are humans and we all make a mistakes and for professional sportsmen disqualification from competitions for the rest of their lives is lik sitting in prison.

That is why I think that every person should have a second chance and the first position is closer to me.

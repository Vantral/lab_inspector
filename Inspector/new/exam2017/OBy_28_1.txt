According to the graph, it is clearly seen that the amount of metals transporting by rail is much more bigger then metals transporting by road, it is respectivly 35% and 11%.

Overall after analazing the information, it can be started then the amount of metals and machinery transportation by rail increase significantly, while the amount of nom-metallic minerals and food products transporting by rails, dramatically decrease in compared with this good driven by road.

 Overall, food products were mostly transported by road, while metals and machinery were transferred by rail.

 To begin with, metals were the major good for rail with 35% of all good transported in that way, comparing to only 11% transported by road.

By contrast, food products transportation is only 11% for railways, while the proportion for road transportation is 30%.

However, there are some goods which were transported in similar proportions for both road and rail transport.

The percentage for manufactured goods transportation were almost the same with 28% transferred by road and 25% by rail.

 In conclusion, a significant difference can be seen only in metals, food products and machinery transportation.

It is noticeable that Facebook is the most popular network among these three, it has more adult users in each age category than Instagram and LinkedIn and more than half representatives of each category use Facebook.

For instance, in the data for Instagram we see a significant difference between the youngest adults' rate and others', first is more than twice bigger than any other rate.

On the other hand, aged people older than 65 almost do not use this social network, the rate for them is only 6%.

As for LinkedIn, this social network has not as many users as Facebook has, but its rates between different age groups are quite stable.

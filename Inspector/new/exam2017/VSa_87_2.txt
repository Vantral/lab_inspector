Banning such people from sport for a limited period, acompanied with public judgment, can be very effective in preventing further incidents.

Those sportsmen that do not respect not just other athletes, but coaches, some legendary figures, fans or the whole country that will suffer from judgement and humiliation do not deserve to present their nation on competitons for the rest of their lives.

But there are few points I would like to underline.

Firstly, some athletes are in need of some medicine to reduce pain, for example, but a lot of drugs that contain illegal components.

To conclude, such serious problem can be fixed not necessary by banning and ruining career of good sportsmen but through serious investigation and testing that will help to prevent such things.

Then it reaches gradually the highest temperature in July (varies from 11 to 22 degrees), and after that it starts again to get colder until December (tempearature varies from -40 to -32 degrees in this month).

It may be concluded that the temperature in Rio de Janeiro does not vary a lot throughout the year, whilst the temperature in Yakutsk is changing dramatically all the year.

Consequently, the climate of Rio de Janeiro is unchangeable and it is warmer than the climate of Yakutsk.

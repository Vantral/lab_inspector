To begin with, it should be noted that athletes spend all their time for sport and it usually means that they cannot work in another sphere.

Hence, if we cancel them to take part in competitions for the rest of their lives, we may make their lives useless.

In addition, all people tend to make some mistakes during their lives, consequently, it is not right not to give them a chance to improve the situation.

Therefore, Although it might be true to say that being a professional spontsman is too responsiable (especially if we talk about international competitions), it does not necessary mean that athletes have to be punished for so long time.

Many people can argue that all athletes knew about possiable result before they use illegal drugs, hence, they must be fully responsiable for their choise.

Provided that the illegal usage of drugs is proved carefully, sportsmen have to be banned from competitions as well as lose their professional status.

To conclude, the issue connected with illegal usage of drugs by athletes provokes heated debates and both sides have strong arguments.

Much as I agree with people, who wanted athletes to be banned forever, I also understand that it cannot overcome the problem at all, and it might be too serious penalty because all people have a right to make mistakes.

It is clear that rails and roads were used differently.

Almost one third of goods transported by rail was metals, while only 11% of transportation by road was occupied by metals.

The percentage of manufactured goods was nearly the same in both cases, 25% and 28% respectively.

What is also seen is that for transporting machinery rail was used more often, because machinery made up 12% of all goods transported by this means of transport.

Metals are also transported by rail in most cases, with the percentage of 35 among all other goods.

As for transportation by road, it is mostly used for food products, manufactured goods, chemicals and non-metallic minerals.

The difference in food products transportation is the most significant, since it is 19%.

To conclude, it is obvious that for some reasons various goods can be transported either by rail or by road.

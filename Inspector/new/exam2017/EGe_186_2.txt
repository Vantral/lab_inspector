On the contrary, local films mostly show just an average citizen of a country which is not only not interesting for local people but is also not so appealing to foreighners who might not understand local culture.

Local companies producing films simply cannot afford to use visual effects, choose breathtaking locations or invite famous actors.

One possible solution that can make local films more popular is to provide film producing companies with financial support.

It will help such companies forget about lack of money and make their wishes come true which will make films more exciting and complicated.

However, as far as I am concerned, governments should not give more financial support to local film companies.

It is not that I am against the idea of financial support, it is just my firm belief that every country should do what it can do best and should not try to become successful in every sphere.

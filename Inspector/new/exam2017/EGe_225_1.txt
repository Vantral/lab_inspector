Two of this charts consist of machinery, matals, chemicals, manufactured good, non-metallic minerals and food products.

Metals on the first part are the biggest part of the chart (35%), while in contrast the second part contains only 11%.

It is clear that the percent of metals transported by rail is higher than by road, and it is also clear that clear that food and manufactured goods have higher level than by road.

There is a big difference between two charts, because it includes the different percent of the goods.

We can see two multiple line graphs displaying the average temperatures between minimum and maximum of two cities : Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro.

Comparing the graphs we can notice that temperature in Yakutsk has more changes than in Rio de Janeiro.

The graph that describes temperature changes in Yakutsk displays a rapid increase of both minimum and maximum temperature from -40 degrees in minimum up to approximately 11 degrees in minimum in period of half a year (January - July).

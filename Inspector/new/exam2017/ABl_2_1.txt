Firstly, it can be seen that Northern Africa is the region with the highest unemployment rate and Southern Asia is the region with the lowest one.

Secondly, it is important to admit that the unemployment rate decreased in the Middle East and Latin America significantly during the explored period, whether in European Union indicator had the opposite dynamics.

Last but not least, change in unemployment remained without any dynamical charges.

It can be seen that the indicator result for unemployment in the explored year was 5,9 constantly.

Overall, the depicted information means that only in the minority of explored regions there is an increasing tendency in unemployment, while in the majority this indicator is only stable or decreasing.

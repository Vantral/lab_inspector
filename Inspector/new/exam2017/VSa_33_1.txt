Overall, it is evident that railroads are used primarily for the transportation of metals, while the main goods transported by drive roads are food products.

By taking a closer look at the charts it can be seen that machinery and metals comprise for just below half of all goods transported by rail, while road transportation of these two types of goods is only of 13% if summarised.

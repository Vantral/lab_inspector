As it can be seen from the charts, metals that are transported by the rail account for 35%, and this type of good is the biggest part of goods transported by the rail.

As it is shown on the charts, machinery constitutes 12% where it is transported by the rail, whereas machinery that is transported by the road constitutes only 2% and it is the most unsignificant good that is transported by the road.

Overall, the most significant good that is transported by the rail is metal (35%), whereas in transportation by the road food products (30%) take the biggest place.

On the contrary, the smallest part of transportation by the rail goes to non-metallic minerals (6%) and in transportation by the road the smallest part goes to machinery (2%).

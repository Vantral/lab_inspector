 To start with, country which can survive without import products to other government is more strong and powerful, because it has independence and economics of other countries can't influence on the different spheres such as politics, social sphere, economics and others.

In addition to this argument, humans who live on the one territory and have great food production, which can solve problems with different people demands (food demands) haven't got enough difficulties like starvation or crysis in food industry, so they have insurance in the future days.

On the other hand, some people say, that in a lot of countries food production is play the main rile in their economics and they can't live without importing this products, because for some reasons (especially this reasons depend on climate and location) governments can't produce other types of products, for example, petrol.

Taking everything into consideration, there are two points of view on the problem of the production and import food to other countries is very controversial, especially for governments, which have only food production.

I believe, that in future years they understand that producing food only for their population give them independence and aim to import as little as possible.

Firstly, these athelets who were caught using doping are not only banned from competing proffesionally but also shamed by society a lot.

On the other hand, I can understand people who believe that if sportsmen has done it on purpose they should be banned for the rest of their lives.

I think, such people shouldn't take part in any competitione Ever again, because they don't admire the rules, that they have to obey.

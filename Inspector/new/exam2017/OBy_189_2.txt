 First of all, there is no doubt that modern people spend a lot of their time near the computer : playing computer games, finding the information for education, working, etc.

And it can be a reason for many problems : overweighting, problems with heart and etc.

Also people move less due to delivery all good that they want (it is unnecessary to go to the shop to buy something), opportunity to gel all information from the Internet (there is no need to go to the library) and etc.

 The possible solution of these problems is making sport more popular.

The first step for this goal is making it cheaper, because sometimes people who want to do sport can not do it because they have not enough money.

Secondly, there should be less advertising of technologies and more advertising of different kinds of sports (also of healthy food and healthy lifestyle).

Further, there should be more special lessons (at school, for example) where students will be tough to live a healthy lifestyle, not to spend a lot of their time using the computer.

 In conclusion, I can say that the widespread use of technology cause many healthy problems And the possible solution of this situation is giving people knowledge about their health and healthy lifestyle and making sport more popular.

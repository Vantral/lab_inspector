All those films became a part of international pop-culture and if you watch, for example, superhero films you always have a topic to discuss with someone who has absolutely different local culture than you and who lives on the other side of our planet.

There is a popular opinion that locally produced films are more specific for the country where they were produced, for example, what is filmed in Balkan countries hardly would be understanded by West European people for language shifts and life style.

And it is also conciderable that local films are more abstract and experimental, so the cultural background is really important.

Blocking the websites is not so useful because there are a lot of routes how to overcome these blocks, for example vpn-services or some computer programms that change your Ip-adress.

Moreover, the punishing measure would territy those users who share the pirate content, because if even the consumering of this files is punished, what the Goverment can do with them?

But it seems that those arguments are good only for businessmans from the industry and their lobbists in authorities not for the whole society.

Firstly, the punishment for downloading such a content means that authorities controll the Internet in many ways.

It opposites the spirit of freedom, which is, as for me, a very important characteristic of the Internet.

So, of course, there is a big problem of illegal content on the Internet but I don't think we should punish people who download it.

The society must find other ways to prevent such cases and I think those ways should be much more friendly to simple Internet users.

Moreover, there is a problem with radiation.

For example, the phones which people use or the electronic resources, where they bake can also bring a harm on health.

To reduce such problems the scietists and innovators should get them into the account.

Firstly, they should produce such technologies that will have much less raiation, that will not be so harmful for people's health.

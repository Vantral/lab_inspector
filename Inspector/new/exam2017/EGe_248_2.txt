In my opinion goverments should introduse laws, when air travels between near cities and countries are not needfull.

In conclusion, goverments can not reduce all plains travelling, because the most people already can not imagine their lifes without plaining.

But goverment can reduce the plainig between near cities, wheen the time of travelling makes up no more than 10 hours.

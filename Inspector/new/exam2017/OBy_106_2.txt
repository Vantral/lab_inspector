In my opinion, the government should allow pirate files in Internet as there are many people who cannot buy the original discs and use Internet to listen to music or to watch film.

Despite the fact that there are a large number of pirate copies, I think that it is not a large problem, because a lot of people still go to cinema and buy CD discs.

According to the information on the graph, they do not.

We can see that while Instagram is dominated by mostly young, 18 - 29 years, people, the is not that much of a difference in percentage of Facebook and LinkedIn users between all 4 age groups.

Moreover, LinkedIn is less popular among the young people than among the elder ones!

At general, people of age 65+ are less active in all 3 social networks than all other age groups, but there is no big decrease in Facebook relatively to younger people.

Such thing is true for age groups of 30 - 49 and 50 - 64 as well while we can see quite a different picture for Instagram with its strong negative correlation between age and popularity and LinkedIn where there is not that much of young people.

Summing the above, Instagram seems to be orientated on mostly young people and LinkedIn on mostly elder people with Facebook being popular among all age groups and more popular in general.

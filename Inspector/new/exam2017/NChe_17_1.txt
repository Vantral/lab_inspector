According to these charts there were some prenailed types of goods which were transported by rail and by road.

As it can be seen from these charts the biggest umount of metals was deliuered by rail transport, but the biggest amount of food products was deliuered by road.

For example, by rail was deliuered approximately 35% of metals by by road only 11%.

Both types of transportation were not used very well for transportation of production of machinery and machinery and non-metallic minerals.

Also by both types of transport were deliuered appronimately equal amount of manufactured goods.

By rail was deliuered 25% of manufactured goods but by road 28% of this production.

In conclusion, different types of transportation haue specializations on different types of production.

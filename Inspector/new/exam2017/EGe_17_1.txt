Thus, the vast majority of the younger generation use Facebook, while the elder generation starting from the age of 65 use it less.

However, the elder generation has a tiny persentage of users, while the younger generation has approximately a half of Instagram`s auditory.

As such, people from the age of 30 to 49 and from 50 to 64 are the most active users.

Together they account around 60 percent of auditory, while the younger generation from 18 to 29 and the elder generation from 65 use it less frequently.

 To conclude, it is obvious that the younger generation use such networks as Facebook and Instagram more often than the older generation.

In these two networks the usage decreases according to the aging of the auditory.

In contrast, in Linkedn the usage is more connected to the social status, because that network is usually used by working class to find a job or to communicate with your collegues.

That is why the active auditory there is from the age of 30 to 64.

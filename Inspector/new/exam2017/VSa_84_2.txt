To begin with, some people argue that if athlete use any illegal drug he must be banned from competition only for a period of several years.

Indeed, it might be a viable solution, because every one has the right to make a mistake, so if the athlete has a time, he will understand that he was wrong at his desicion and then he will train more and more to avoid the using of such drugs in the following competition.

The obvious advantage of this solution is that the sportsman should not stop his career, which might be the central part of his life.

From the other side, there is an opinion that the athletes used illegal drugs must be banned from the professional sport forever.

Despite there being a lot of debates about the opportunity of using any drugs in order to increase sport skills, sportsmen should stay carefull, because such measures might destroy their health.

As for the latter, I strongly believe that its using by professional sportsmen is the worse way to gain success.

That is why it might be necessary to banned such sportsmen from competing not only for 2 or 3 years, but for the rest of life.

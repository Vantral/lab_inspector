Overall, it can be seen that metals is the main good transported by rail, while food products are mainly transported by road.

 The rate of metals among goods transported by rail in Eastern Europe is high, at 35%.

The rate of chemicals as well as the rate of food products and is low among goods transported by rail.

The rest is for non-metallic minerals and machinery which rates among all goods is the lowest.

 Approximately one third of all goods transferred by road are food products, while the amount of manufactured goods is lower, at the rate of 28%.

To my mind, it's fair and morally justificated to pay for someone's else work no matter what type of work you're dealing with.

Thirdly, it's really important to protect the unique feature of musical and film industries when only the ones who are ready to pay for access to an art should take this opportunity.

However, some people assume that everyone should get an access to films and music because it's impossible to destroy the market of pirate copies and in this case all the limitations don't make sense.

I totally disagree with this point of view because there is an improvement of law system and the system of market's control and the amount of pirate copies decreases.

All things considered, I totally believe that musicians and film producers should get the whole amount of money for their work and everyone who ignores the law of intellectual property should be punished.

There is an opinion that countries should produce only the food that their nation eats and by that reduce the import as much as possible.

Our country also has sort of income because buying food from other countries is probably cheaper to produce it by yourself.

Summing up, I would like to mention that lowing production of local food and increasing import of it will no doubt have a positive impact on every single attribute of modern life and can also improve the economy.

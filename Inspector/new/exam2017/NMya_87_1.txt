The legend tells us that the line that represents the maximum temperature is solid with dots, containing crosses incide, and the other one, which shows the minimum value of the mont, has solid dots and dotted line.

The temperature in Yakutsk starts in January from -40 degrees, then increases significantly to 25 degrees maximum and 10 minimum in July, and then drops bask to -40 and -35 accordingly by the end of the year.

The gap between the highest and the lowest temperature does differ too : from January to June is width is about 5 degrees, and after that it norrows down to 2 and a half or so.

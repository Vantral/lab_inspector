Overall, it is a general trend that the transporting of manufactured goods has one of the highest persentage in both cases.

However, the highest in the first pie chart is metals compared with food products in the second one.

In the case of rails it is clear from the diagram that the leaders are metals and manufactured goods (35 and 25 percent respectively) while the chemicals and food have both 11 persent of transporting, and machinery has 12.

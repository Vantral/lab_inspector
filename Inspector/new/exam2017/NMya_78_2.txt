Also, we can ecck at the experiance when our country (Russia) was USSR, and when we didn't contact with many other countrie, and aim to import as little as possible, and nevertheless we have a bed situation whith import.

In conclusion, to sum up, I would like to say that it is obvious, that countries should not aim to import, because it's so important for each countrie, consequently I claim that it's easy to produce the food for import and for own populatont eats.

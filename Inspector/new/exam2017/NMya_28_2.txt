In truth, young people commit a lot of crimes nowadays and I see two main reasons for that.

Crime is not only a much easier way for young people if we speak about non-violent crime, but also an act of commiting the crime becomes unaccepted for people.

And working fair becomes harder and harder for young, especially just graduated, people as they can't find a job that suits them due to the lack of experience.

Young people, especially children and teenagers, watch a lot of films where criminals are such said "cool guys": rich, loved by women and sometime even acting better, than police itself.

Thus the crime doesn't seem as bad anymore, or it might seem bad, but very cool, and young people want to look cool.

It is more of an educative matter, parents and teachers should really teach the children that regardless of how cool it looks or how easy it may be, a crime is always a crime.

If we just keep telling teenagers that crime is what you can get caught for - they wouldn't stop.

Pie charts show us the percentage of transported goods both by rail and by road.

Overall can be seen, that the most transportable good by rail is metals and by road is food products.

 At first the less transportable goods by rail are chemicals, food products, both are 11%, and machinery, which is only 12%.

Furthermore, the less transportable goods by road is machinery, which contains only 2%.

 Comparing those two charts should be pointed out, that percentage of manufactured goods, chemicals and non-metallic minerals are nearly equal.

However, the number of machinery, metals and food products are different.

 To sum up, the most transportable goods are manufactured goods, because is has nearly equal high percentage in both charts.

Whereas the less transportable good is machinery, because in is only 12% transported by rail and 2% transported by road.

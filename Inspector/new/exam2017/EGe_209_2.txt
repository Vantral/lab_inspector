As many people think that spending money on the space program is just a waste of money, I can agree with them.

The reason why some people think that exploring space is a waste of money is that the government can spend those money for something more useful for people.

That is why I think that governments have to spend money on space exploring, because only government can help science to do even something in the space program.

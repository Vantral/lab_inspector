Nowadays it's a usual thing to buy a pirate copy of any film or music that you like or just to download them from the Internet for free.

On the one hand, some people think that people who don't want to pay money for music and films and try to find them for free should be punished.

Their position is clear, because of course people who create all these things got nothing for lots of time, money and talent they needed to create that or another song or film, which is not really honest.

Also illegal copies bring lots of money to their owners, who in fact do nothing but copying the material created by others, so film producers and musicians have to deal with money problems connected with their art; whereas other people who don't work as much as they are and just cell their works become very rich.

But on the other hand, illegal copies of music and films can be a good advertisement of people who created them.

For example, you won't pay much money to go to a concert of a musician, whose art you don't know really well, but if it's your favorite singer, whose songs you've accidently found in the Internet, of course you'll buy a ticket even if it costs a lot.

 To talk about myself, I agree with the second position, because it's very difficult to become popular and, what is more important, stay popular only with the help of legal sources of your art.

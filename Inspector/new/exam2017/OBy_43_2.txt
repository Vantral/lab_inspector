It call 2 types of problems : contemporary problems with health from transport is, for example, if you are hit by car and now your arm is broken.

Long-lasting problem from transport is gases in air, gases from engines, can't name a problem but I know then breathing by period wastes is not so helpful for your body.

We can solve that problems, if we use electro-engines or something like that.

For example, factory put wastes to nearly lake, fish in lake eat wastes and became not so good for eating, but we don't know it, and that fish was killed and served to our kitchen table, and after that we had stomach problems.

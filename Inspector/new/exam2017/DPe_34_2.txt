So the are no need to punish people who let us to try some movies and music and then decide of we want it to buy Secondly, some educational movies should be avaliable to watch them for free, because forcing people to pay for basic knowledge of world leads to the uneducated nations and global problems - so at least Discovery and National Geographic programs should not take fee.

 To begin, according to the diagrams, the biggest part of goods moved by trains is metals, 35%, while the highest percentage of goods transported by road refers to the food products, 30%> However, the second pie chart shows that the number for manufactured goods for road transportation is close to food, 28%.

Also, machinery takes the least of transportation by road, only 2%, while it is the 3rd in rating for rail, 12%.

It should be noted that the figures for manufactured goods are almost the same in the percentage for both means of transport, with only 3% more for road transportations.

 All in all, the main trend for rail is to serve for transportation of hard or heavy goods like metals or machinery, while others types of good are used to be moved by the road.

Metals are the biggest part of this transportation : 35% of metals are transported by railway.

The second chart is about the transportation by road.

The main goods of this way of the transportation are food products (30%) and manufactured products (28%).

It seems that if a product has a bigger weight, it would transport by railway, and metals are a good example.

Chemicals do not have a great percentage in both ways of the transportation as well as non-metallic minerals.

It is possible that it is a normal number for this kind of goods because they are not as important as food products or manufactured products.

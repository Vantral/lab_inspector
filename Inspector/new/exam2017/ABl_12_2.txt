There are some arguments against this point of view.

Firstly, the illegal pirate copies of films and music appear in the internet after the premier of the film in cinemas.

In 2 weeks the producers of this film usually can gain a lot of money from cinemas and usually the amount of money is more that a budget of the film.

Then, it can be easily seen, that the governments of the different countries all over the world try to ban web-sites in the internet, where people can download pirate copies of films.

But this policy of blocking web-sites doesn't work, because there are a lot of hackers, who can hack the system and continue to share illegal files.

Although there are drawbacks to such actions, I would argue that these are outweighed by the benefits.

(hdsfvu) The main disadvantage of this tendency is that this process leads to the monopoly of worldwide brands that dictete thier own terms.

Moreover, these actions are completely unprofitable for economy of a country and slows down the process of globalization and global economy.

That means that countries that have market economy could not exist with the monopoly and it can lead to the destruction of the political system.

Customers are considered to prefer the brands that are very common, so as not to risk.

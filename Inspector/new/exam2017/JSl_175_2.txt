Potentially people who are already in prison have more chances to make a crime so it could be a good idea to take them longer in prison but after all they still should be exit.

The world around us changes and the longer prison sentences means the harder returning to a normal life in society it creates big risks for those who only exit the prison after a long times.

The main aim of the prison is to punish and improve the people, but does it actually improve people?

For example in some Scandinavian countries prisoners have ability to reduse their time in prison by reading some books and then passing a tests about knowledge of this books.

It is possible to give them some work or social work at which they will earn money to reduce costs for the government.

Overall, I think there a lot of better ways to improve people and help them to return to a normal life than give the, longer prison sentences.

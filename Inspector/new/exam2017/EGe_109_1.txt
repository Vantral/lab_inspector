Yet the amount of people of middle age (30 49 and 50 64) who use Facebook is twice bigger that the amount of ones who use LinkedIn - what is more, it seems to be the least popular among the youth.

Overall, we can conclude that the social network Facebook that is made mostly for simple communication is widely used, at the same time such platforms for sharing pictures and working are not very favorable in the USA.

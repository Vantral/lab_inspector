Average temperatures in Rio de Janeiro and Yakutsk differ significantly over the course of a year; while graph representing Rio looks almost like a straight line, with maximum temperature bouncing between 20 and 30 C and minimum temperature somewhere between 18 and 24 C respectively, second graph resembles a parabola function, reaching its peak in July at 23 C and then dropping below -40 C during winter season.

As for comparison, there is not much in common between them.

The gap between their temperatures in winter is absurdly huge, reaching 70 C in worst cases, but strangely the temperature in Rio seems to fall a bit in summer, so it sometimes can happen that temperature in Yakutsk gets higher, than in Rio.

As it had already been stated, temperature in Rio rises during January and February, and falls off during summer, which is a result of climatic and geographic features of a city, while temperature in Yakutsk changes the other way around, reaching its peak in mid-summer.

In addition to that, it can also be noticed that the difference between the maximum and minimum graph in Rio is bigger and more unstable, than the difference in Yakutsk.

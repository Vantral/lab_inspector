Secondly, the dicrease of 1% in the Middle East and in North Amera and the stability of other regions, exept European Union, where, however, therease isn't very big, make the worldwide unemployment rate stable at 5,9%.

The positive sides of it are the appearance of new jobs and solution of labour problem in developing regions - the Middle East, Latin America and South Asia.

However, the minuses are the stability of high unemployment in one of the poorest regions in the world - North Africa and the growing unemployment in different countries.

To sum up, the little changes in unemployment rate in certain regions don't affect the worldwide rate, although these regions cover big parts of the world.

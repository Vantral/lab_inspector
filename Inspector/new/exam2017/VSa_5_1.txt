Generally, the metals transportation mostly was by rail, when food products was the first in transportation by road.

As can be seen from the chart, the most popular goods which transported by rail were metals 35% and manufactured goods 25%.

At the same time the quantity of food product transported by road was three times higher than by rail and the most significant among goods transported by road 30%.

There was a strengh correlation between the machinery transportation and the method of doing it, so machinery transportation had only 2% in the chart of goods transported by road which was a much larger in railways transportation 12%.

The charts show that the transportation of non-metallic minerals had the opposite situation and was the least in the chart of goods transported by rail.

To sum up, the proportions of metals and food products transportation were nearly the same 35% and 30% in different charts and had the first position in different charts.

In this case kids do not get enough moral education, and a lack of that can result into a child becoming cruel, as he or she does not know what good and bad is.

As this issue is extremely important for the society, parents and teachers definitely should do something to decrease the level of kids' cruelty to prevent them from becoming criminals.

The most important thing they can do is to pay more attention towards children's development and their moral education.

Kids should be taught about good and bad from the very young age, and they should feel that they are cared about.

In this way, they will be much less likely to experience willingness to commit a crime.

In order to reach such a goal, parents and teachers should control the media products that children consume to avoid the situation, in which they watch horrors only.

They should suggest that children read more books and watch more movies that will establish right moral values an teach them how to behave.

To sum up, more crimes commited by young people are caused by the huge amount of violence affecting them, which comes from both media products they tend to consume and from the lack of their parents' attention.

As a solution to this issue I suggest that parents and teachers should pay more attention towards kids and try to establish moral values and teach them about good and bad from the very young age.

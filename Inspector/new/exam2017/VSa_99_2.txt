Finally, although some athletes think that using drugs there is no any impact on their health, it is proven by scientists that such substances influence on people's coordination, heartbeat and breathing.

On the other hand, there are lots of people who claim that athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives.

However, in my opinion, to ban athletes forever is not moral.

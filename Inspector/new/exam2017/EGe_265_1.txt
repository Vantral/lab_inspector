The pie charts illustrate the percentage of goods which were trasported by two types of transport - rail and road - across the countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.

Turning to the similarities and diffirences between the charts, it is necessary to notice that, as it is obvious from the pics, proportions of some goods are fairly equal to one another.

To put it more precisely, manufactured goods transportation accounts for 25 per cent of all goods transported by rail, and, concerning the road type, the percentage is slightly more at 28 per cent.

The percentage of transported chemicals is not significant in both cases : that is less than a quarter, 11 per cent and 16 per cent by rail and road respectively.

The charts show approximately the same proportion concerning non-metallic minerals, though its level at 13 percent is more in the field of road transportation.

For instance, food products are transported predominantly by road transport units (30 per cent), whereas its number concerning rail transport accounts for 11 per cent.

The gap between the percentage of transported machinery is also relatively considerable : it accounts for 12 per cent in the case of rail transportation and for 2 per cent concerning road one.

To sum up, as it is seen from the pie charts, the numbers of products of all types which were transported in Eastern Europe in 2008 by road and by rail do not deffer as extremely as it could be.

Firstly,it is obvious that the number of the white representatives in the USA was outnumbered by the UK general population.

Moreover the quantity of the white UK citizens who were imprisoned was also larger than the amount of the american prisoners.

Secondly, the graphs illustrate that the non-white general population was three times larger in the USA rather than in the UK.

Furthermore this very evidence can be proved by the number of the white dwellers in the UK(12%) and in the USA(36%).

Thirdly, the percentage of the non-white prisoners in both countries was different enough.

In the Uk there was less than a third of non-white men imprisoned meanwhile in the USA it can be seen more than two-thirds of the same representatives.

Overall, in the UK the number of white population prevailed as in general as in prison terms.

However in the USA in 2015 the non-white citizens were more imprisoned than the white ones .

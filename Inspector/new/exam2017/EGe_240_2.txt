Due to the increasing intersts in travel around the world, air travel has become the most popular way of getting from one place to another, because it is proven to be the easiest and the fastest at the same time.

Moreover, reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure can cause warious difficulties in international communication, cause economical declines in some countires, due to the decreasing number of tourisits visiting them, and may even cause some political problems.

Secondly, in order to lessen the amount of time spent in the air, airplanes that companies produce become faster and stronger and thus, need more fuel and produce more waste.

Thirdly, there are another means of transport that are also becoming more popular, such as ships or trains, which may be more ecologically friendly, than modern airplanes.

The pie charts illustrate the percentage of different materials transported by trains and vehicles between European countries 9 years ago.

Consequently, it influenced the percentage of food products that replaced most of previous material spot, so here is a gap in 19 per cents.

In comparison, non-metallic minerals have almost the same percentage but in another order.

To conclude, some of materials is easier to transport by rail, like metals.

However, food products need special conditions, so it is frequently transported by vehicles.

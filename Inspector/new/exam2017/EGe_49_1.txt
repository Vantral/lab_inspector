The graphs reflect the number of citizens and the level of birth and death throughout the USA history.

It is clear that both birth and death rate and population size remained almost the same during the period from 1750 to 1800.

However, since the beginning of the nineteenth century until 1850 the death rate dramatically decreased from 34 to 21 per 1000.

On the other hand, birth rate slightly decreased from 38 to 34 per 1000.

As a result, the USA population grew to 25 million people.

Both birth and death rate kept falling down until 1950, but, nevertheless, birth rate was significantly higher than death rate.

Due to that population size increased and grew into 150 million people in 1950.

Birth rate remained stable from 1950 to 2000, but birth rate sharply increased.

As a result, there was a huge rise in the population size from 150 million to 270 million citizens.

As we can see, the balance between birth and death rate has a huge effect on the size of the USA population.

As it can be seen, in the UsA the number of non-white prisoners considerably overweighs the quantity of white prisoners.

As for general population the situation is otherwise, the percentage of white people is far more than the non-white.

Moving to the UK we can notice that the general population almost entirely consists of white citizens and the percentage of them reaches a peak at 88.

The prison population is also made up by the white.

In contrast with the UK, the USA has a essentially higher number of the non-white.

Overall, the general quantity of white population in the UK significantly exceeds the number of the white in the USA.

However, there are some problems with illegal copying.

The first one is that popular film makers and musicians do not get all the income they can.

The second one is that sometimes they do not understand how popular they really are as there is no evidance or statics about people downloading it.

As a solution producers and musicians can allow to download some of their products for free and ask money for some other.

To sum up, illegal copying and sharing music and films is not such a big crime for that people should be punished in some way.

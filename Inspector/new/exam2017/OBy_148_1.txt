The line graphs illustrate the average temperatures (maximum and minimum) in two different cities.

 As for Yakutsk, the highest (almost 25*C) and the lowest (about -40*C) temperatures differ a lot.

The same for these temperatures is that the line of maximum and minimum have the same shape in every city : steady rise from the beginning of the year to July, where is the highest temperature, and more rapid decline, to December in Yakutsk, and fluctuating during all the year in Rio de Janeiro.

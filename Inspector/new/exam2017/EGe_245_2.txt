Unfortunetely, this question is very complicated; it does not seem possible to have this question answerde immediately.

On te one hand, air pollution could be mortal to nature and, therefore, human as well, since it leads to global warming.

On the other hand, we should also pay attention to other factors, because air travel is not the only source that pollutes air and enviroment.

To my mind, air travel is overestimated.

I shoul admit, that it is very comforatble, since it is usually the fastes way to travel.

As I've said earlier, car gases, even smoking and breathind produce carbon dioxide and, therefore, pollute air.

But the biggest harm is, of coarse, provided by factories, especially the ones that produce metal and energy( from oil for example).

The government has to try decreasing number of these kind of factories, or use alternative ways of energy and working with metal.

Building nuclear power station instead of oil/gas power station could be very helpful, since it was many times Scientifically proved to be more enviromentally friendly.

As a whole, it is important to keep in mind that solving this enviromenatal problem should be priority now, specially when we talk about air pollution.

To conclude, we deffinately should use air transport less, sinse it pollutes air and causes to huger enviromental problems.

However, we mustn't forget, that there are more significant factors, which lead to air pollution.

So probably, it woud be more helpful to try getting rid of them, since they can easily provide even more enviromental problems.

Overall, from pie-charts it is clearly seen that the amount of food products, transported by road is much higher than by rail; manufactured goods and chemicals follow the similar trends; but machinery has a great difference in transportation.

Firstly, it can be seen, that the amount of food products, transported by road was doubled, in comparison with products, transported by rail.

(30% and 11%) Manufactured goods were quite equal in figures : both were about 26 percent.

Finally, it can be seen that all products followed different trends, but there were some exeptions like manufactured goods and chemicals.

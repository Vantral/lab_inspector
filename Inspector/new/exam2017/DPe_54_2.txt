Nowadays, more and more people copying and sharing music or films on the Internets for free, but most of them don not understand that every year musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money from illegal pirate copies.

In my personal point of view, I think that copying and sharing music or films on the Internet and people who download these should not be punished, because now going to cinema, for example, is not cheap and not many people can go there every week.

To summarise all previous fact I want to say that it should not be punishment for copying and sharing music or films on the Internet, and what about musicians and film producers they got enough of money and with illegal pirate copies, if someone really like one group or film he will go to the concert or in the cinema.

Overall this information includes such goods as machinery, metals, manufacturing stuff, chemicals and non-metallic minerals.

It is clearly seen from the charts, that the main part of railway transportation is metals, which cinsist 35% of all goods, while the considerable part of the second chart is given to food products (30%).

The smallest percentage of all goods is related to non-metallic minerals on the first picture (approximately 4%) and machinery (2%) on the second.

In stark contrast, machinery transported by rail consist 12%, but this amount of food products (11%) in comparison with the same position in the second chart (30%) is lower.

The next thing is that the proportion between manufactured goods and chemicals in both chart is rather equal : 25% and 16% are transported by car.

Overall, these charts illustrate differences in the transportation of goods.

It is clearly seen, that the main difference is in transporting metals and food products, while other aspects have nearly the similar percentage.

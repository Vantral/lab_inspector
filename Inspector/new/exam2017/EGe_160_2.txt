Nevertheless, I am sure that the main reason is the fact that the most of countries are oriented on American culture and some people want to look like Americans or British.

On the one hand, the level of American and British films is rather high and it would be difficult to do something better or at least the same.

Although I think that the American and British cinema are the best, I am sure that local industries can show something significant and people will like these films.

To sum it up, some people reckon that American and British films are the best nowadays but it would be interesting if governments provide more financial support to local film industries.

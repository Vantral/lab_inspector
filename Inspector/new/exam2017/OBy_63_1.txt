There are two round diagrams, that is divided into six palets : machinery, metals, food products, non-metallic minerals, chemicals and manufactured good.

We can see two varites of moving good (by rail and by road) in Europe in 2008.

 On the first chalets we can see significantly much metal transported by rail (35%).

Food products, which transported by road much lager, then food products, which transported by rail, roundly on 29%.

Manufactured doogs on the twice charts are same, they have 25% by rail and 28% by road.

Should note here that 2 charts are different, but some positions they have similar.

So clear that metals possible transported by rail and by road, but food products better transported by road, although metals better transopt by rai.

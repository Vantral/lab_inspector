Due to this fact, jures do not have to collect the whole information about the athlete and can make a decision far more faster, because they would have precident in their practice.

On the other hand, the athletes need to recognize their mistake and to inculcate virtues and the professional ethics they have to be banned for some period of time.

Furthermore, the carreer in this sphere is complex and people, who choose it practically always do only training activities for their whole life, so they have no time to get another qualification and higher education.

In conclusion, there is no the only right way to solve the problem of using illegal drugs in sports field, but I stress the opinion that people from this sphere should have an opportunity to continue their career in any case after the period of time.

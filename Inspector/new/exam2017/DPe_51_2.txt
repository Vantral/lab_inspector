Although, some people treat that fact neutrally or even support the idea of free aquiring of the files they want, there is a law in almost all the counties worldwide that is supposed to punish such initiatives and, to my mind, it is the only way to preserve some artist's exclusive rights and help the industies to keep developing.

Moreover, the pirate activity impacts harmfully on the development of such spheres as film-making industry and music, since it weakens the incentives of artists, to some extent, to make better products in the future, since the files downloaded by fans fofree while they are supposed to be purchased for money is the feedback from the audience that goes with no respect.

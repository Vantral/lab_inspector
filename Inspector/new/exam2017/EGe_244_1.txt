It can be deduced from the graph that the average minimum temperature in Rio de Janeiro remained practically unchanged at the temperature of 22 degrees Celcies over zero.

Similarly, the maximum temperature was stable throughout the whole period under discussion at approximately 30 degrees Celsies over zero.

Overall, summarizing all information provided it can be stated that the average temperatures in Rio de Janeiro are constantly about 20 or 30 degrees celcies over zero during the whole year.

At the same time the average temperatures in Yakutsk went down maximum to 35 degrees Celcies below zero, then had the peak at the level of 25 over zero and ,finally, went back to the last temperature.

As we can see, the average temperature in Yakutsk is unpredictably high in July, as it is in Rio de Janeiro, and totally little in the rest part of the year.

The pie charts show that there are good transported by rail and by road in Eeastern Europe in 2008.

Globally, in both charts transportation of goods consist of 35% metals and 30 of food products respectively.

In the first case the parts of metats (35%), manufactured goods (25%), machinery (12%) have the highest overall percentage.

As it can be seen from the first pie chart there is no any information about the non-metallic minerals.

However, the smallest indicator where good transported by road is machinery.

Overall, it is clear that influence of such factors as machinerary, food products, chemicals where goods transported by rail is not so significant in countries of Eestern Europe in 2008.

As a result, there will be less people who want to find a job and country's economy will definitely suffer from that decrease in the number of employers.

All in all, I believe that governments and political parties should pay attention to both advantages and disadvantages of this system before using it in the economy of any country in the world.

In my opinion, this system may help poor people, but at the same time destroy economic prosperity.

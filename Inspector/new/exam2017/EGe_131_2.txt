For centuries sport has been an important part of our life and the advantages of doing some kind of sport is evident, but nowadays most people prefer watching other people take part in sports competitions rather than participate, and there are hot debates whether watching sports is a waste of time or not.

They watch a game or a competition sitting on a sofa and eating, but instead of that they could go out and work out themselves, they spend their free time on reading, walking or any other activity that will only bring them good.

The only benefit they may get from this is emotions and adrenaline, but the wasted mtime and money for tickets is not worth it, as it could be spent for something more useful.

For example, many people nowadays spend too much time on watching sports instead of working, and as a result they don't have money to provide their families and themselves with food, clothes and other necessary things.

In conclusion, I would like to add that my personal view is that there are no benefits that would be worth wasting free time on watching sports and we should encourage people to work out, to take part in competitions instead of watching others do that.

Nowadays, some people still believe that countries only need to produce the food for their population's consumption and should import as little as possible.

Despite I do not have a degree in economics or in relatable field, I will try my best to explain my disagreement.

To begin with, growing all consumable food inside the country brings up a threat of global starvation for all country residents due to bad harvests and/or cataclysms, and importing as little as possible will be a tough strike to state's economy that will most likely result in decline of quality of life throughout the country.

 Secondly, not all countries have enogh fertile farm lands to produce enough food to all their population, and alternative methods of producing food are not as effective.

Also, a lot of countries have imperfect climate for all sorts of food to grow, and some consist mostly of deserts, which makes said strategy at least questionable.

At last, even if all countries will manage to keep this policy, a lot of consumer food products become unavailable to most of people, and it may have some serious impact in the life of most people.

To conclude, the policy, stated in the beginning will have a devastating impact on any country, that decides to implement it, and only the healthy proportions of internal production and import can lead to stability and prosperity.

Firts of all, this way of sollution the air pollution problem seems to be less harmful for economics : while environmental solution mentioned above demands extra expenses on special equipment, this proposal suggests reducing the amount of benefits maintaining the mechanism of the average air flights scheme.

To sum it all up, it should be said, that now the most beneficial way to solve all the problems connected with environmental problems out of air travel is to have some changes in flight politics.

Introducing laws and rules, rearranging air travel system means saving the very principle of air travel business, helping the environment at the same time, which seems paradoxically less devoted to environment but more environmentally friendly and effective.

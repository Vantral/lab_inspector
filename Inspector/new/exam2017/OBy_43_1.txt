There is the circular graphs : the first one show information about percentage of rail-transported goods, a second one show information about road-transported goods.

Look at the first graph.

The biggest percent is Metals (35%).

After metals, we see 'Manufactured goods'.

Less percent has chemicals, food and non-metallic minerals.

By the way, transporting food by the road is more popular than transporting it by rail (30% to 10%).

So, we can think that road transport is more fast than rail-transport (trains), because food is fast-dying material, and speed of transportation is general factor.

Also, a lot of manufactured goods are transported by road, but the pretty same percent is transported by rail (25% to 28%).

In other categories, there is same percent, except metal, 35% of all road transporting system are remove metals from place to place.

Well, we can summarise then that heave things like metal are transporting by rails, and light things like food and manufactured goods are transporting by road.

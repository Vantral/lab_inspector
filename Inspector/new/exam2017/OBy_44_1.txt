As we could see the persentage of transported chemicals is almosm equal, 11% by rail and 16% by road.

Almost the same trend we could see on Food products parts, but there the biggest percentage of that goods which was transportated by road, was 30 per cent.

Finally, we pay attention for non-metallic minerals, which difference is a bit bigger more than a half - 6 per cent by rail and 13 percent by road.

Both charts represent the information about goods which are transported by various ways : by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008.

As can be seen from the first chart, the lowest percentage of goods transported by rail belongs to non-metallic minerals.

Overall, the similar amount of goods transported by two different ways belongs to manufactured goods : 25% and 28%, while in other spheres these percentages change depended on transportation way.

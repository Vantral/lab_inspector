Some people think that the best way is to give longer prison sentences, while others believe that there are an alternative ways of reducing crime.

The first point of view can exist, but I'm not absolutely agree.

I don't believe that it can help to reduce crime, because prisoners can used to it, to approximately live in prison.

Some prisoners don't care about stay in prison during a life or a few years.

However, it's also a good punichement anyway.

I suppose that the most criminals spent their childhood in awful conditions with violence.

So when the grow up they became agressive and desperate in life and start to commit crimes.

I think that it's possible for government to take care of such families, invest money for the better future.

I realise that it is not the best way to reduce crime, but it's a try.

Another way I see is to make an influence on child and tell them the consequences of commited crime.

Also they should grow up in the warm and lovely atmosphere.

I suggest that everything starts in the childhood.

Moreover, there is a more rough way - death penalty, but I can't absolutely agree, because it can happen with the innocence prisoner, but anyway it's good way to scare criminals.

Of course there are a lot of ways to reduce crime, but all the tries will be useless, if the majority of people continue to think that they can do everything.

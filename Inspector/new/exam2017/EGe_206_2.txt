Money spendings on space exploration is often being questioned by some people, because they say that money being used by space programs are more needed on some more appliable things, like society problems or environmental issues.

In my point of view people that are against space programs are right in some aspects but i disagree with them in their main argument -- "space exploration is a waste of money".

My only point against space exploration is the fact of governments of different countries are corrupt, and money that would go in normal government for space development will be taken by someone.

We can see that the lowest temperature is acheived in January (-42).

Therefore, the diagram of average temperature in Yakutsk is n-shaped and we can see an ascent from January to July and then we can see a descent.

In Rio the amplitude is much smaller.

The highest possible temperature is acheived in January (+30) and the louest at July (18).

Moreover, we can see that the shapes of diagrams are different.

In Rio average temperature dedlines from January till July, so it is u-shaped, what is vice versa in Yakutsk.

Such a big difference in amplitude of diagrams can be explained by different climate types.

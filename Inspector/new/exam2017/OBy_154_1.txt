This is not the case for Rio de Janeiro, where temperatures are a lot more stable throughout, with the minimum being around +17*C in the summer to the maximum of +29 30*C in the winter.

 Of course, the most obvious observation is that Rio de Janeiro is much warmer than Yakutsk, the temperature does not go below +15*C, which is not true for Yakutsk.

 In both cities the maximum and the minimum temperatures in the same months do not differ very much.

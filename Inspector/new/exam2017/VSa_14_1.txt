First of all, food products account for 30% of goods transported by road, whilst by rail the figures is about 3 time smaller.

The segment of non-metalllic minerals transportation in the overall structure of road transportation is aproximmatly twice as big as in railway transportation structure.

Taking everything into consideration, it could be concluded that, machinery and metals goods are predominant in rail transportation.

In contrast food products, chemicals and non-metallic minerals make up the majority of road transportation.

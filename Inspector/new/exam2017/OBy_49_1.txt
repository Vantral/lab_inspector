Firstly, the biggest amount of percentage in goods transported by rail was in Metals with 35%, while in the second chart it was food with 30%.

Clearly, that goods with high amount transported by rail, and the answere, for example, the amount of percentage of food products increased in road type of transportation and fell by rail.

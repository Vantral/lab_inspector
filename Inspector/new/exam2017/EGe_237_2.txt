To my mind, many other ways to solve problem of polluting air might be found.

Moreover, more and more companies including those that are responsible for air transfer start following the "green trend" which means that they try to adjust their products to new high ecological standarts.

For example, they develop new models that need less fuel.

In addition, if the amount of travelling by air was reduced, people would likely use other means of transport more.

The following increase in the usage of cars, trains and ship will escalate the situation with global pollution, because they are far from being immaculate in terms of ecology too.

As a result, the reduce of flights seems to alternate one problem with another which makes a given proposal not ideal.

On the other hand, the discussed suggestion might give positive results if air companies decrease the number of flights by opening more direct destinations.

The improvement in technology and logistics seems to be the best ways to provide people with quick and eco-friendly means of transport including airplanes.

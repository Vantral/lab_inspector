There are a lot of differences between two graphs.

The most striking one is that temperature in Yakutsk rises slightly from winter to summer (with difference of temperatures about 5 degrees) and then fall down again in early autumn.

While temperature in Rio de Janeiro remains stable with a little fluctuations from 17 degrees in the most cold year to 30 in the hottest one.

 Also, Russian months in winter are the coolest and summer are the hottest, when in Brazil things are completely inversed.

For example, the hottest month in Russia is very close to the same month in Brazil with only 5 or 4 degrees difference (25*C to 30).

The most outstanding feature is, however, the fact that the difference between the hottest and the coolest months is completely the same for both Russia and Brazil (about 7 or 10 degrees).

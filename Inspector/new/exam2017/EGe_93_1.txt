The first thing that should be mentioned is the fact that the number of people reached its peak in 2000 so it's it the most striking difference.

Furthermore, according to the graph it can be seen that the birth rate in early 1750s was quite low, and the situation remained the same up until 1800.

Finally, the number of Americans escalated sharply in the second half of the 20th century, which can be explained by the sudden sharp rise of birth rate.

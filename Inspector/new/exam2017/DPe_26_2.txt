On the one hand, people should not create illegal pirate copies and spread it through the Internet due to several reasons.

To begin with, if people have free access to music or films, musicians and film producers do not get enough money for their work.

If nobody is responsible for theft of music and films other people will not have incentives to buy the original discs and start to use pirate copies.

On the other hand, copying and sharing music or films is not theft in its usual sense.

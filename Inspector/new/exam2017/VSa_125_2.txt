The second main point of these people's view is that all of the illegal drugs will move out from person's body after two-years period.

In my opinion, sportsmen caught using illegal drugs shouldn't take part in any other professional competition at all, because it's highly important to protect other athletes from their possible cheating.

Because if a person went against the rules one time, he could do it again.

To sum up, nowadays athletes caught using illegal drugs are banned from professional competitions for only 2 years, but it is possible that the ruler will changes and such people wouldn't take part in them at all.

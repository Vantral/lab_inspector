There is an idea that countries should produse food only to cover their own population needs and lower the import as much as possible.

I am complitely disagree with this idea because wise import and export of food benefits the country.

Obviously, that some countries can not produse some kind of food due to the location orl weather factors, but they can get it in exchange for money or othe resourses from other countries.

Moreover, rich nations can help poor ones by sending them food, if government understand that they have far more that they need.

This logic also works in case of helping population suffering from natural disasters.

To sum up, there are enough arguments to say, that food import and export is benefitial for country in many ways.

Presumably, closing the food traffic and consentraiting only at covering population needs - is a dead end for almost every country development.

Some people like watching British and American films and prefer them to locally produced films.

There are some reasons for such preferance.

	The first idea that I would like to discuss is the fact that in many countries film production is not very developed.

The United States and Endland are definitely not such countries.

And people living in countries without the developed film industries simply do not have an option to wath films produced locally and they obviously watch American, British (and so on) films.

	This problem can be solved if governments of such countries support local film industries financially.

I think this is a very good idea because producing a film requires a considerable amount of money and young film directors may simply unable to produce a film without some financial support from the government.

	Moreover, in some countries particular genres of films are simply not popular while these genres are popular in the USA or the GB.

For example, film industries in Russia very rarely produce science-fiction films and never produce science-fiction TV series.

Thus, science-fiction fans in Russia watch foreign films.

This is another reason for people not to watch locally produced fims.

	The second reason is very actual to me because I like science-fiction and I watch foreign films and TV series.

	To sum up, I would like to say that see no problem if a person prefers to watch American or British films.

There are some reasons for this.

Nevertheless, I would also like to add that governments should give more financial support to local film industries because it could help to develop some genres that are not yet developed in local film industries or help it to appear if there is no film industries at all.

The provided pie charts reveals the data about six goods which are transpoted by rail and by road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.

It is noticiable that metals, machinery, manufacturad goods, chemicals, non-metallic minerals and food products are traded using as the road and so the rails, too.

Nevertheless, the diagrams look comlitely different.

The main feature of the first diagram is that the metals are transported by the trains more than other goods.

It takes almost 1/3 part of the diagram.

While the food products shows the same result as the most transported good with the cars.

The second popular good for transportation by train and at the same time by the road is manufactured products.

The rest 1/3 part of the first pie-chart goes for food products, machinery, and non-minallic mineral as 11, 12, 8 o/o respectively.

Likewise, the 1/3 of the second chart are for non-metallic minerals, machinery and metals - 13, 2, 11 o/o respectively.

Thus, we can state that machinery isn't the most transported good as using the rails and road either.

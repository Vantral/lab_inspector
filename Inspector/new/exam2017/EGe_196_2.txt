There are several reasons for this situation and I'll discuss some of them in my essay.

First of all, someone's decision to watch a film or not is usually based on their expectations of the film's quality.

For example, if a person wants to watch a science fiction or fantastic film, he or she wants to see there special effects of high quality, and it is reasonable to think that they would be much better in a Holliwood film with a big budget.

Secondly, people's desire to watch some film often depends on its publicity.

Local film companies often do not have enough money to widely advertise their product, so public may not even be informed well enough about the film and would prefer to spend money on watching a Holliwood blockbuster with famous actors instead of some independent film.

Some people believe that governments should invest money in local film companies in order to change this situation.

I do not agree with this point of view.

In my opinion, film production does not differ from any other commercial industry.

Therefore, the ability to find investors is a part of this business.

In addition, there is a danger that government would invest only in the films with 'proper' plots, which means that they will control directors' freedom of speech.

To sum up, there are many reasons for people to choose foreign films and not local ones.

While some people argue that it is a worrying trend which must be changed through governments policy, it is actually a normal situation in modern world of commerce.

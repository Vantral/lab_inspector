As can bee seen from the diagrams, metal is usally transported by rail (35% of whole transportation against only 11% by road).

Certainly, itis preferred to use railway to move machinery, so the share of it in the first chart is 10% higher than in the second one.

In conclusion, rail is more convenient to transport machinery and metals while the road is preferable for moving food products and non-metallic minerals.

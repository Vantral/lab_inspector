On the one hand, every person can make a mistake, especially, in these cases, sometimes the fault is not on the athlets, but on there staff members and doctors.

For example, in 2016 the Olympic Games were held in Brazil, where most of Russian Federation's team was disqualified for the reason of using illegal drugs.

On the other hand, cheating in sport events, such as Olympic games etc.

For instance, there are many examples of athlets cheating, by using drugs, that were disqualified and some time later, after return, were caught again.

In this case, punishment should be harder.

In my opinion, both of these examples are horrifuing.

I think, that there should be some new, modern sistem and also different rules must be exepted.

Moreover, I believe, that by making rules harder the problem of using illegal drugs will be more or less solved.

In conclusion, there are a lot of problems nowadays with illegal drugs that can be solved by changing firstly, the system secondly, people's (athlet's) mindset on these issues.

All in all, in my point of view sportmens should be banned for the first time, but after can be banned for the rest of their lives, depending on the case

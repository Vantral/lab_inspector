Two graphs demonstrate to us average temperatures in cold Yakutsk, located in Russia and warm Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Let's analyze temperature dispersion in Yakutsk.

There is stable grow from winter to summer and slow decrease from summer to winter.

That's normal situation, but we can see that temperature in Rio de Janeiro never fall under approximately 17Â°C.

In fact, summer in Rio lasts all year and never end.

The lower point of temperature in Yakutsk can be found in January and December, it equals -40Â°C, the highest point is under 30Â°C.

We can see that the average temperature in Rio slowly decrease from January to July and grow again to December.

 In conclusion, that aren't a lot of same between average temperatures in this cities, but in Rio all period of year "summer".

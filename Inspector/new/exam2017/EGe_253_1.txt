As can be seen from the first pie chart the biggest number of goods transported by rail is for metals - 35%.

The percentage for food products and manufactured goods remain the same for this year approximatily 30%.

Besides, nearly the same quantity has chemicals and non-metallic minerals about 15%.

To compare, if in the first image the smallest number of percents is for non-metallic minerals, in this graph it is for machinery - just 2%.

To conclude, as it may be seen from the provided chart the goods which transported by railway very often is metals;however, by road - food products.

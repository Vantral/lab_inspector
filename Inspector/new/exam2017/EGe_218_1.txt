It can be deduced from the first graph that maximum temperatures in Brazil remains practically unchanged throughout the whole year, flacuating between 30 degrees and 25 degrees in winter and summer respectively.

In contrast, minimum temperatures in Brazil can drop from 25 degrees in January to approximately 15 degrees in July and then rise to about 20 degrees in December.

Speaking about Yakutsk, Russia, it can be noticed from the second graph that maximum temperatures show a steady upward trend increasing from namely minus 40 degrees in January to approximately plus 30 degrees in July, with a following dramatical decrease to about minus 40 degrees in December.

Similarly, minimum temperatures rise from minus 40 degrees in January to plus 10 in July, demonstrating a five-time increase, and then fall back to minus 40 degrees in December.

Overall, after analysing the information given, it can be stated that both minimum and maximum temperatures in Russian city demonstrate a significant growth in summer months and dramatical decline in winter months, while in Brazilian city minimum and maximum temperatures flactuate between 20 and 30 degrees in their summer months and 20 and 25 degrees in their winter month.

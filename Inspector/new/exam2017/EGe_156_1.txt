The line graph provides data about population of the USA over more that two centuries period.

To begin, it is remarkable that the population size remained stable until 1800.

However, it is worth mentioning that at the same period of time the birth rate climbs to the point of 38 per 1000 people.

The graph of the death rate also shows the upward trend.

Furthermore, although the size of population has increased gradually since 1800, the birth rate has dropped to the point of nearly 21 per 1000 people, while the death rate has decreased by 50%.

One more thing to be mentioned is during the recent period birth rate has reached the point of more than 25 per 1000 people, while the death rate maintains the same level and has no upward trend.

To conclude, despite the fact the birth rate and dearth rate fluctuate, the steady increase in the size of population in the USA can be observed.

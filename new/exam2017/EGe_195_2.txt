First of all, people's choice is caused by a lot of different factors, if some movie is getting more popular than others, it probably means that it has better video and audio effects, visual picture is more entertaining or the plot better catches attention of the person watching the movie.

At the same time a local film can be totally ignored by people just because producers don't have enough money to advertise it.

At the age of the Internet things become easier to find, it means both that people from other countries can see movies from America and England, and that people from the US or UK can, for instance, watch shows from India or any other country, but the problem is that English is spoken in a lot of places and it is not that difficult to understand the story of the film, while language barrier makes it hard to watch local movies from other countries.

The budget of local movies is really small and they can't afford to spend more on the translation of the movie.

Governments could have offered free traslation of the movies to best local film industries, so the movies they make could become famous in other parts of the world.

To sum up, I believe that there are two main reasons for British and American movies being so popular all over the world.

A lot of people can speak English, but not many can understand languages from other world regions, which makes it is easier for movies from the US or UK to spread.

Many people are aware that illegal copying music and films should be punished, while others consider that it is not illegal action.

From my point of view, the copying is the same as the theft and should be banned on the Internet.

One convincing argument in favor of is that it leads to big costs for musicians and film producers.

As a result of it, the price of original products becomes higher and other people, who would like to listen to music or to watch a new film, should pay for these illegal actions on the Internet.

Some of them are not able to do it, so they have not alternative ways to buy an access to original products and tended to use the Internet, too.

The last, but not least argument is that the illegal pirate copies usually have a low quality, and people form their opinion about the work of musician; artist or film director according to these works.

As a result of it, there are negative comments, which, unfortunately, affected the significance of the film and forme public opinion.

However, some people claim that illegal copying and sharing different types of art is an essential action and should not be punished.

The high prices for discs and tickets at the cinema or exhibition make art available only for people with high income.

But pirate copies are available for everyone on the Internet and people may watch a film or listen to music for free.

I strongly disagree with this point of view.

As it was mentioned before, the price for all films and music depends on costs, which musicians and films directors have.

If the government had addressed the problem 10 years ago or imposed strict laws against illegal copying, the situation could be changed and the price of all products could be significantly smaller, which would definitely make art available for everyone.

In conclusion I would like to say that copying and sharing music or films on the Internet creates a lot of problems for original authors and should be banned in order to protect their property.

But this protection should be closely connected with measures against high price for music and art, which should make it available for everyone.

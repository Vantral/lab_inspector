One of the first things to note is that Facebook seems to be the most popular type of the Internet communication among all age groups.

Finally, LinkedIn is the only social network where the percentage of 30 - 49 - years old users overtakes the percentage of 18 - 29 - years old users.

Overall, as the age of people grows both Facebook and Instagram become less popular.

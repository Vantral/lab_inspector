There are two graphs that show average minimum and maximum temperature in two cities.

It is easy to see that the peak in temperatures in Yakutsk is reached in July, in Rio de Janeiro maximum temperature was in January and February and minimum in February.

This difference in peaks happened because cities are located in the different parts of the world - that is why temperatures in Yakutsk rose from January to July and fell from July to December and temperatures in Rio de Janeiro fell from January to July and rose from July to December.

Temperatures in Yakutsk changed from - 40 Â°C to 2 Â°C fro minimum temperature and from - 35 Â°C to 25 Â°C for maximum temperatures.

In Rio de Janeiro minimum temperature changes from 18 Â°C in July to 24 Â°C in February and maximum temperature from 25 Â°C in June and September to 30 Â°C in January and February, so it is obvious that climate in Yakutsk is more rough.

It is seen from the graphs that temperature in Rio de Janeiro was never lower than 17 Â°C in that year and in Yakutsk temperature dropped below zero and reached - 40 Â°C in the coldest months.

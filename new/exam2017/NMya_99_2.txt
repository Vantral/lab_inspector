Taking into consideration my point of view, I can agree with this statement, because if countries produce more goods like food inside the country, it won't affect the economic position of the country and more money that were used for import would stay inside the country.

Also it is very useful for hard political situations when import of food can not be processed or the country can have an economical crisis when there is not enough funds to import goods.

On the other hand, i can not agree with this topic because, unfortunately, not all countries have possibilities and facilities to grow a large amount of goods inside the country.

To sum it all up, producing food inside your country is a great thing, that can be used in a proper way, but we cannot live without importing goods because of different really important reasons, which can cause difficulties in relationships with other countries.

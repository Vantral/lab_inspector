Moreover, that illegal medicines give more chances to win for participants from developed countries because they can provide their athletes contemporary drugs by modern techologies while developing countries cannot afford it because of lack of money and qualificated scholars.

Furthermore, they believe that if sportman uses illegal drugs he broke rules of world sports community and could not be its member again.

Hence, I believe that if the athlet use drugs first time, he should be banned for 2 years but if more than once, he should be punished by banning for the rest of their lives.

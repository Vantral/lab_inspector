On the one hand, the elemination of drugged athletes is a honest way of punishment.

As for those who think about the banning from competing professionally for the rest of live, I think, it must be a worth reason for this.

In my opinion, the judge should take a decision after working other the case and the aspects that cause drugging.

On the other hand, there are athletes that are drugging during all their sport career, and they are doing this intentionally for getting the best score.

I think that there are cases, when the punishment is enough for two years, for example, but also there are athletes who need much more, and banning from competing for the rest of their life is the best way for their career.

The first graph illustrates the tendency of the USA population from 1750 to 2000.

As we it can be seen, the number of American population was growing quite steadily from year to year without any sharp loops.

After being at its lowest point, the population started to increase in 1850 adding about 100 million a year.

At the same time a contrast tendency can be noticed in birth and death rate.

The birth and death related lines reached its' peaks in 1800 before dropping considerably enough in 1850.

To sum up, while the first graph demonstrates the changes, the growth in particular, of population, the second one represents birth rate and death rate in the period from 1750 till 2000.

Both these graphs illustrate an essential and obvious correlation between these two aspects.

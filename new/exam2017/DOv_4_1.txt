So Instagram and LinkedIn has similar rates, which are doubled by Facebook.

Also Facebook and Instagram have similar age distribution, which significantly differs from Linked In one.

These differences might be attributed to different purpose and target audience.

So it is likaly that varying percentage rates are caused by these reasons.

Facebook and Instagram have a similar tendency to be more attractive to a younger audience, however their numbers differ greatly, with Facebook dominating the market at 87% of people aged 18 29 using it, as well as 56% of people over 65, which is considerably less, but still extremely impressive compared to the other two.

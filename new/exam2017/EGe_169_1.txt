It can be seen from the first sight that oveall amount of time women spent doing sport on regular basis in England in 2012 was almost always smaller than that of men.

It can also be seen that the youngest women (16 24 years old) and the oldest ones (over 75 years old) spent twice less time (or even less) exercising than men of these ages (114,1 minutes vs.

The only example against this tendency can be spotted in the 5th two figures standing for the everage amount of time men and women of the age 55 64 years spent exercising : in that case the time dedicated to sport of women (55,4 minutes) was slightly bigger than that of men (52,7 minutes).

The second most prominent trend is that the average time people spent doing sport in England in 2012 was constantly reducing with their age raising.

There is again one contr-example : 65 74 years old men dedicated more of their time (about 60 minutes) than 55 64 years old men (just above 50 minutes).

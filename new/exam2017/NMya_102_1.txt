First of all, it can be seen that metals are mainly transported by rail, making up 35% of the traffic, whereas roads are busy with food transportation, which is responsible for 30% of the traffic.

In contrast, only 11% of road transportation consists of metal and food, accordingly.

The second main difference is machinery, taking up 12% of rail traffic and 2% of road traffic.

it is compromised by the fact that the share of non-metallic minerals is almost twice as large on rail than on road, making up 13% in the last case.

It is also worth noticing that manufactured goods take up similar shares : 25% on rail and 28% on road.

Finally, 16% of the road traffic is chemicals, while on rail it is only 11%.

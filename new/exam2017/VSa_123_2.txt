Some people might argue that, saying that a person has to be perfectly aware of the list of banned components in drugs, nevertheless, I am convinced that new rules appear every day and they are quite hard to be predicted.

My opponents may object, claiming that illegal drugs usage in professional sport is a very serious crime and people who are convinced of it must take their punishment, however I find that it is a simple cheating which certainly can be forgiven.

For instance, if an athlete has already been accused of taking illegal drugs before or if he takes part in some extremelly famous world competition and breaks this ground rules, the punishment might be heavier.

Although I can agree that due to these or other circumstances a person can be resticted from competing, I still don't think that he or her should be banned forever.

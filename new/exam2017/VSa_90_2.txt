However, the punishment for those who were caught on such an unfair business elicits controvesy : while some people claim that these sportsmen must be excluded from competitions for the rest of their lives, others say that it can only be done for a limited period of time.

In my viewpoint, those who think that we should bann athlets using drugs for the unlimited period have several reasons for it.

First of all, nowadays cheating during the competition have became such a wide-spread appearance that only strict measures can prevent it from further expansion.

Another reason is the fact that winning with the help of drugs is against the simpliest aspects of our moral code that says that it is highly unfair to act this way, expecially in respond to those who are loosing while following the rules.

Their main argument is that athletes are often forced to use drugs by their coaches and other people who also gain success if they win.

Due to this, sportsmen should not be eliminated for the rest of their lives, instead, it is better to punish those who are also involved in crime.

Moreover, people clame that even if an athlete is actually the one to blame, he can improve his attitude and overlook his values.

Even though it might be true to say that the evil can be battled in every human, hence, we should give the blamed athletes a chance to prove that they can win without cheating, I believe that the first approach towards the problem of drugs in sports would be more correct in the present situation.

Even though softer measures can be taken in the future, right now the issue of the discussion is out of control, so only the highest measures taken by government and society can prevent it from becoming even more crucial.

It is widely argued that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible.

And while people usually bring up damage to importing country's economy as a main reason to why they think that way, I strongly disagree with that idea for a number of reasons listed below.

First off, in order to stay healthy people need vitamins and other nutrition elements.

Those elements can be found in different kinds of food from all over the world.

Obviously, no country in the world can produce all of the world's variety of food within its borders, so to compensate for that said country need to rely on import.

That alone is a reason for importing food, but to expand on my point I think it should be noted that the wider choice people have, the better it is for the country's economy.

Secondly, importing food can be beneficial for country's economy in the ways that might not be obvious For example, if a country is producing too much of a certain article of food, it can export the overhead and as such compensate for the possible economical damage of importing other kinds food required for the healthy diet of an average citizen, whereas if not for importing food the economy would stagnate pretty quick.

 To sum up, I think importing is not necessarily a bad thing, because diversity in food is beneficial for the population's health and also importing allows for exporting overheads and not worrying about starving the population.

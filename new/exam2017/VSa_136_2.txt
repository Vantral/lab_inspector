First point to be consider is that sportsmen, who are banned from competing for their whole life will hardly find another place in society.

Looking at this issue from another point of view, a limited break in sport career will not necesseraly mean, that an athlet will stop using illegal drugs.

It is my strong believe, that to break somebody's life because of political issues is too cruel.

Nevetheless, it seems to me that arguments for a limited period outweight arguments against it.

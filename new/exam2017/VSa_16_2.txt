This are likely to be related with use of computers at home and for working, because such activity is in a sitting pose, which is the most unwanted for a healthy spine.

Second problem that is obvious is a reduction of vision quality, caused by a constant eyes efforts while people are watching monitors or using their devices.

To avoid deseases of spine, people should not to spent much time in a unchangable sitting position, for instance, it is nessessary to make some physical exersises during working, if it is possible, some computer activities should be done lying on the floor, at home, for example.

Similarly, eyes should change their focus time after time to reduce the negative affects, also it is recommended to watch at something green-coloured, such as plants and other objects.

To summarize, health problems are often related with an increasing role of the technologies in people lives, but this unwanted effect might be neutralized, following some important rules.

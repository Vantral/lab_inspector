Some people claim that this process is a crime as you steal someone's product of intellectual property and the crime should be punished.

 To begin with, I strongly agree with the fact that pirate copie is a theft because, as told by the legal law, the process of film copying is not legal as well as people involved in film-making and music-making are not getting payed for.

Their job properly as their salaries are mostly based on the box office for tiloms and wages from sales of music tracks, vinyl and CD-disks for music tracks.

In my opinion, as far as every job should be payed and due to the fact of respect for the musicians and film producers people should purchase such things.

 The part about punishing people for downloading pirate copies is the part I should disagree with.

I think that these people are less guilty than those one who made a copy and even if there is a place for punishment it should not be too tough.

To summarize all the points I stated here, I came to the conclusion that downloading products of someone's intellectual property at least is not fair.

This theft cannot be left unnoticed but the biggest part of it is in hand of the "pirate" himself while the punishment for the downloaders should be minimal.

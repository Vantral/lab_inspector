The most significant tendency is that people spend less time doing sport when they become older, for example, young men spend approximately 282 hours (two times more than women - it is the widest gap between genders) whereas men over 75 do sports just under 30 hours (women - 10).

The most significant gap is between the youngest and the oldest while men and women between 25 and 74 do not show as much difference (less than 50% difference).

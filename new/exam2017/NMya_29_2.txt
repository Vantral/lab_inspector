In my opinion, the most prominent reasons for a high crime rate among young people is a lack of sufficient education in school and high inequality between social classes.

Young people from the lower classes of society are not satisfied with this state of affairs, which drags them to committing more robberies and thefts.

Take a student who lacks money for his education and living.

The only way for him to get money is to violate the law because he cannot find an appropriate job.

Considering the causes of high crime rate among young people, schools and parents should provide more education to young people.

Teacher and parents should speak more about the danger of becoming a criminal and suggest that young people can achieve success without being perpetrators.

Taking into account all above-mentioned factors, it is obvious that high amount of young criminals constitutes a serious problem with deep causes.

 Overall, the general trend of both diagrams is having higher percentage in the number of manufactured goods and chemicals.

 First of all, the biggest share of goods transported by rail have metals, so as thy make 35% of all goods transported by rail.

In contrast, the biggest proportion of goods which are transported by road make food products with the percentage of 30.

 However, there are several similarities between the diagrams.

The proportions of manufactured goods are almost the same and make one forth of the whole goods transported both by road and by rail.

In addition, the shares of chemicals in both methods of transportation do not vary too much and make 11% and 16%.

 To sum up, although these pie charts have similarities, there are several differences, therefore the shares of each transported good do not make the same percentage in both ways of transportation.

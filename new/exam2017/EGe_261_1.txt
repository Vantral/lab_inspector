It can be deduced of the first diagram that the biggest part of all railway transportation makes metal - it is 35 percent of total amount.

It can also be noticed that the parts of Chemicals, food products and Machinery transported are almost equal - 11 percent for the first and second and 12 percent for the third.

although Manufactured goods make the 28 percent of total road tranportation, which is almost equal to the amount of food tranported.

The pie chart also shows that amount of raw industrial goods, which are chemicals, metals and non-metallic minerals makes 30 percent, as it is for food products.

To sum up, if the most transported by rail tipe of good is metal, for the road transportation it is food products.

the amount of food transported by rail makes 11 percent of total amount, which is three-time decrise in comparison to the second chart.

It can also be said, that percentage of manufactured goods transportation is almost equal in both diagrams.

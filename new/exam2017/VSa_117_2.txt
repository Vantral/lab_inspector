The first point to consider is that sportsmen should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period (eg.

Although athlets who use illegal drugs would be banned for limited period, they could continue their professional career.

The idea that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionaly for the rest of their lives, in my point of view, is brilliant.

First of all, this measure can prevent the use of illegal drugs in sport, because all athlets want take part in competitions.

It is interesting to note that, according to many psychologists, this idea is workable solution.

I firmly belive that such sportsman should be excluded from competing professionaly for the rest of their lives because this measure can prevent the use of illegal drugs in sport : young athlets would not have bad examples and the sportsmen who used illegal drugs could not take part in the professional competitions at all.

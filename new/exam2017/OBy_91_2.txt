Many people believe that all the online contents should have their copyrights protected as well as online piracy should be considered as crime.

In my opinion, I think that there should be punishments for online piracy; the punishment should be lowered base on the types of content.

 Although online piracy is contributed to many financial problems as well as human brain draing, I think that it should be considered as heavy crime and punishments can be djusted.

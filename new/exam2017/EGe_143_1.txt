The population reached 25 million in 1850, when the difference between birth rate and death rate was the most remarkable.

For next fifty years the level of birth bounced back, the number changed remarkably and reached its peak in 2000 with approximately 300 million.

In conclusion, I would like to say that the number of citizens in USA increased moderately for 150 years and grew fast in 20th century, but we should mention that for all this years the birth rate exceeded the death rate, which helped the grow.

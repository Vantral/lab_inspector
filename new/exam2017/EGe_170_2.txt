Governments of the biggest countries make investments in exploring the space outside planet Earth, and it leads to a question : wouldn't it be better to focus on the problems around us, make people's lives on Earth better, and solve the planet's issues before looking up into the space?

Space exploration is one of the newest fields and there is still a lot to be done and found out.

The technologies developed by space explorers may later be used in everyday life, they help environmentalists to protect the planet from destroying processes such as global warning.

One of the goals set by space explorers is to find a way to leave the planet if something goes wrong and save the humanity at least partly.

I suppose this is not the best goal because we should focus on preventing such a situation and caring about everybody's lives instead of making sure there is a way to escape for some outstanding individuals.

Also there is a big wealth gap in the society and people who work in very closed and technological fields, such as space exploration, clearly have a higher income.

As for me the problem of poverty can be fixed by a more balanced income rate in different professional fields.

Both are really important, but increasing the quality of citizens' lives should be a priority for governments.

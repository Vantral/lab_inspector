Some people suppose that it is essential to find firstly solutions to issues on the Earth, and only after that explore space, other being the complete opposites to this point of view.

On the one hand, through discovering the space society is able to obtain knowledge abot the Universe and its laws of physics.

For instance, it can be fruitful because of the fact that people can implement this knowledge on the Earth in order to invent some new technologies based on what they have found out in the space.

For instance, people in developing countries suffer from poverty, in Africa there a lot of villages where there is a lack of drinking water and food.

I strongly believe that countries with a good economy should fund money into projects which transport essential goods to the countries with the lack of money.

When both sides of the argument are looked at I would like to emphasize the fact that space exploration being a fruitful field of science still should not be more important for us than solving some economical and environmental urgent issues.

If we do not fund projects to solve tackling problems, it will inevitably lead to economical crisis or environmental disaster.

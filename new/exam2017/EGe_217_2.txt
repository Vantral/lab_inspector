Nowadays the air travel is one of the most popular ways of travelling.

It is fast, comfortable and now it is getting cheaper due to the increasing number of so-called "low-coaster" airlines.

However, there are those, who are concerned with air travel's inevitable harm to the ecology and therefore the amount of those who use this way of travelling should be reduced.

In my opinion, the problem of pollution caused by airplanes is an important and underestimated one.

The advantages of the air travel are obvious for people, but this disadvantage does not concern them a lot, although the airplanes are one of the most dangerous transport for ecology.

Airplanes produce a lot of harmful polluting gases such as carbon dioxide, which leads not only to the air pollution, but also to causing the global warming effect.

Consequently, it would be great if governments will stop the spreading of air transport.

The problem is, however, that all the alternative ways of travelling or transportion different things are even worse.

For instance, there are different ships, for passengers and for transportation of goods.

What makes them worse is the fact that they require more time to move from, for example, Australia to Europe.

And in the same moment they require aproximately the same amount of fuel (or even more) as planes.

So the pollution to the ecology caused by them would be as big as planes'.

What is more, there is almost no another way of moving from one continent to the other, and trains, or cars, or trucks, if there will be more of them on some continent because of reduced amount of airplanes, will paralyse the traffic system, to say nothing about the harm it will cause to the ecology.

However, there are some attempts to change the situation.

For example, I heard of projects of an airplane which is powered by electricity.

It still, as I understand, pollutes the air (the electricity does not come from nothing, unfortunately), but less then the fuel-powered airplanes.

Thus, someday there may be an opportunity to stop (or, at least, pause) the pollution of the environment.

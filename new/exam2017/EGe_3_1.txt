The bar charts illustrate the amount of white and non-white people in general and in prison in the UK and the USA in 2015.

As it can be seen the percentage of non-white population in the USA outnumbers the amount of the same population in the UK.

In the UK the white population makes the majority of general and prison population.

In comparison, while there is more white people in general population of the USA, the figure of non-white prison population outweights.

There are almost three white men to every six non-white men in prison.

The feasible reason for this can be the fact that the number of white and non-white populations in the USA is slightly equall.

In the UK the non-white population makes only a quarter of the whole population.

Therefore, it should be said that the non-white population in the USA is three times more than in the UK.

In general, we can see that the amount of non-white population in the USA differs from the amount of the USA.
<In PRP><general AJ0><, PUN><we PNP><can VM0><see VVI><that CJT><the AT0><amount NN1><of PRF><non-white AJ0><population NN1><in PRP><the AT0><USA NP0><differs VVZ><from PRP><the AT0><amount NN1><of PRF><the AT0><USA NP0><. SENT>@
That is why we can not judge if non-white people are keen to be in prison more often than white people.

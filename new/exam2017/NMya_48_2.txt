Firstly, the main result of producing and selling pirate copies is that musicians and producers lose money, and really huge summs.

The second point, which I can support, is the fact, that pirates can use musical and film copies for selling and make illegal money, which is criminal in many developed countries.

So, two first facts shows that I agree with the fact of punishment, because producers and musician lose much money and can not invest it in their new projects.

To sum up, I can state, that the punishment should be realized only for big criminals, for creating special pirate sites with stolen original content.

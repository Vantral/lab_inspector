Nowadays it is often claimed that the increasing usage of different modern technology leads to various diseases.

The most significant and spread problems are the ones with the sight and with the lungs.

To begin with, both children and adults use their computers and mobile phones more and more every day.

This can have negative impacts on their eyes, because they are tense all the time.

What is also harmful is that mobile phones are held too close to the eyes while using, which is even worse for them.

The most obvious solution to this health problem is to get rid of its cause, in other words, to use mobile phones less.

But the world is developing so rapidly that it is not really possible, since phones have become a big part of the lives.

Another way to improve sight or to prevent it from getting worse is to make different exercises for the relaxation of the eyes' muscles.

The next problem is connected with the environment and the lungs.

The development of modern technology includes the increasing usage of cars, factories, which influence the condition of the environment.

The air, which we breathe, contains many elements that can harm our lungs, and this is what is happening now.

This problem is much more difficult to solve, because it is seldom possible just to move to the place with the better environment.

The solution should be more global, the owners of the factories should think of making them more environmentally friendly, the producers of the cars should do the same.

Percentages of people, who like specific resourses, are quite impressive, because nearly all adults are involved in online chatting, information sharing significantly

In case of Facebook, it has more users than other networks : even in the oldest group, who do not use internet much, Facebook leads with 56% versus only 6% for Instagram and 22% for LinkedIn.

The trend is going down while age of users increases : almost 1/3 rentnors sit on Facebook than students.

We observe the same situation when we look at Instagram data : young people are the majority of all users (53% vs 42% of adults).

By the way, the speed of trends slumping is higher : elderly people are nearly 9 times rare sharing pictures that young do.

On the contrary, LinkedIn data demonstrates the correlation between age and social role of users : mostly working people aged 30 to 64 use LinkedIn for obviously business purposes, though students and reenty graduates as well as older people are only 8 9% less using this network.

In general, there are same in percent with manufactured good transported.

In case, manufactured goods had a similar percent (28% in road, 25% in rail).

Also, non-metallic minerals was transported with 13% by road and 17% by rail, which means the same situation like goods and chemical.

In the same time, the charts show differents between machinery and food products.

Overall, in such difficult transport systems, the same position had manufactured goods, chemicals and non-metallic minerals.

Nowadays there is a tendency that huge bussiness companies are becoming far more popular than small local companies with their own identity.

To begin with, with the development of large multinational brands it is becoming drastically complicated for small start-ups to gain the popularity and become highly appealling to potential customers.

For example, people who are used to do shopping in huge shopping malls are not likely to choose a small company or shop to buy something for themselves.

Another disadvantage that I can distinguish is that because of this tendency small local bussinesses are prone to lose their culture and some unique features.

For instance, when you come to any touristic place in Europe and come to a local shop, there are not many local goods or symbols of the country you have come - there are just post cards or some really ordinary clothes, hence if you want to get some national spirit, you should get acquainted with the locals.

To be more precise, nowadays there are plenty of shopping malls where everybody regardless of their social class can find everything they want.

I mean that even though there is a gap between classes, anybody can be as smart and fashionable as others.

Undoubtedly,in small local businesses there are quite peculiar goods, but they are far cheaper than in malls, hence you will look less appealling than people who do shopping in such shops.

All things considered, I genuinely believe the trend of losing small local bussinesses` popularity is rather dismal and I would be really pleased if this situation could be changed.

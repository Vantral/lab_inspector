There are two main opinions : the one is that athelets should not be banned for the rest of their career if they are caught in this crime; another is that they should.

The first point is that athlets, who use illegal drugs, should not attend competitions for a limited period of time.

This opinion may be appropriate, because drugs will leave the organism after some time, and their influence would not be usefull.

On the other hand, there is no doubt that this situation may be repeated after the limited of time, so there is no point that this kind of atheletes should be banned forever.

This point of view is reasonable too.

It is not fair that drugs-free athletes should participate on competitions with persons, who are more powerful and whose power was provided by illegal support.

In this case, it is vital to restrickt the access to professional competitions for overdrugged athelets.

To conclude, both views on the problem of illegal drugs and their importance in the professional sport have a chance to be discussed.

As for me, I strongly believe that athelets, who used illegal drugs once, should not be acceptable for a professional competitions, because their achievements are not true and fair, and I think if someone commit a crime once, he or she would repeat it after some time.

Of course, I have no right to judge somebody, but rules of sport should be strict.

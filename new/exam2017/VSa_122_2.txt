In the modern world there are lists of certain drugs that are forbidden for professional athletes.

However, the punishment for using them is still a matter of arguement for many people.

Some people believe that a limited period of disqualification is enough, while others insist on banning guilty sportsmen and sportswomen for life.

First of all, I would like to draw attention to the differences of these lists of forbidden drugs in different countries.

As long as there is no mutual agreement there is no point in searching for a fair punishment.

In this case there will not take place any international scandal like the one with Russian athletes year ago.

Secondly, there are different amounts of drugs taken and various situations.

I suppose every athlete should be judged individually.

In this case a limited period of banning and banning for the rest of one's career might be just two possible scenarios, so both sides of the argument could be satisfied.

On the other hand, illegal drugs not only make the competitions unfair but also harm athletes' health.

Considering this point it might be proper to have strict laws and punishment for the usage of them in order to prevent others from taking these drugs.

Although banning professionals for life doesn't seem to be correct and effective.

Taking into consideration each argument mentioned above, it occurs to me that both sides offer different solutions both which could be used in one fair system.

I assume that each case deserves to be analysed separately, nevertheless it does not mean that the punishment for using illegal drugs should not be strict.

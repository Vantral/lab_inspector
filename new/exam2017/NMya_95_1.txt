The multiply line graph demonstrates the average temperature for the period of year in Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro.

One of the lines shows the average month maximums, another one represents minimums.

As it is clearly seen from the graph, average temperature in Yakutsk started from the lowest points and then steadily increased from January to July.

The peak is in July, and it is about twenty five degrees for maximum temperature and ten degrees for minimum.

The graphs started from the peak in January and slowly decreased until reaching the lowest point in July.

After this, the maximum temperature line fluctuated a little and started to rise, when the minimum temperature line began to grow immediately.

All in all, the Yakutsk graph are much more sharp than the Rio de Janeiro graphs where all the dips and increases were marginal near the Yakutsk.

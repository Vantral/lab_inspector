It is considered by scientists that travelling by air has a great harmful impact on our environment and leads to global warming.

Needless to say that it is much slower and less convenient, but governments should encourage such conscious changes of planes and, for instance, provide cheaper tickets for those who decided not to fly but to drive.

In conclusion, it is important to point out that all these ways of reducing air polluting and global warming which are caused by air travel are not very profitable for governments and airlines, but they can solve the problem.

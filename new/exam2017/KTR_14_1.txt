Generally speaking both ways of transporting goods are used mostly far manufactured goods, melats and food products.

The biggest part of railway transportation is metals with 35%, while food is the most transporded good by road with 30%.

For both ways of transportation almost third part is manufactured goods with 25% by rail and 28% by road.

This difference is not that significant as these two goods togeather have almost same parts of pie charts with 11% and about 3% by rail and 16% and 13% by road.

What is more, machinery goods are more transported by rail with 12%, while 2% with road.

The main reason for this difference is that machinery good and less transportable

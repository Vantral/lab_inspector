In first diagram, which shows us results of transporting goods by rail, we can see that the most popular thing is metals, but on second pie chart we can see that the most popular part is food product.

Also if we look at 2 of them, we'll understand that one part of all amount of goods is nearly the same, it is manufactured goods.

 To sum up, there are lots of differenties in ways of transporting goods.

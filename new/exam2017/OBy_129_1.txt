This picture illustrates us the information about temperature at two cities, which located in different climate zones.

 Both graphs show us an average data of maximum and minimum points at every month but the situation in Yakutsk is more variable than Rio de Janeiro.

When the positive temperature in Yakutsk is only at summer period, Rio de Janeiro is stabily has a temperature higher than zero.

The situation ar the beginning of a year in Yakutsk is the rapid growth of temperature indicaters to getting the peak at summer, in July.

As about Rio de Janeiro, that amplitude of maximum and minimum monthly indicators is about 10*C.

Boths graphs have the same thing : the difference between maximum and minimum average parametres in one month is usually less than 15*C.

 To sum up, both cities show us very different climate.

Whereas, people at Rio de Janeiro always spend more their time with warm weather, Yakutsk is usually frozen at winter nights and has a comfortable temperature only at summer.

It may be argued that one who was once caught should be frightened of being caught again - this will predestine that culprit will never attempt to cheat once more.

The sound argument for banning culpable athlets forever is that sport society needs to be cleaned from those who do not attain sport's moral code.

To conclude, two points of view have been discussed : one was to ban athlets using prohibited drugs for a period of time and other - to disqualificate them for the rest of their career.

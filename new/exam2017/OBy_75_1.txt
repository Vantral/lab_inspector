 Generally speaking, rail transportation is important for metals and transportation by road was more common for food products.

The role of rail in transportation of food products and chemicals was the same but not so important from the 'road' pie chart it is clear that it was the most unconvienient way for machinery.

The first chart's data says that the metals has the biggest percentage - 35%.

Also, the same percentage between chemicals and food production is 11% that is the same with percentage of amount of metals was transported by road.

As can be seen from the second chart, only 2% fall on machinery - transportation by road was not the best way.

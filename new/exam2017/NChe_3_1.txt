As can be seen from the charts, there are differenses between two methods of transportation.

Metals account for approximately one third of goods transported by rail whereas only 11% of goods transported by road are metals.

The enormous difference can bee seen in food products that constitute 30% of goods transported by road while rail transportations of food are three times less.

To conclude, it should be added that the main differences between ways of transportation are seen at metals, machinery and food products.

First of all, due to losing money from illegal pirate copies some film producers do not have any chances to continue film production.

Anyway, it also may be a problem if producer's name is not worldwide knowen.

I think that to solute such problem it is nesseccary for government to help film producers to decrease the cost of cinema tickets and DVD discs.

It will lead to pirate copies reduction.

If it is impossible, pirates must be punished with an expensive fee.

Another problem made by illegal copies is that some video clips appear on the Internet before it's official relise.

Finally, unpunished copying and sharing music and film on the Internet show to young generation that it is normal.

So I believe that if this situation does not stop now, in future people will have much more problems with illegal copies.

Firstly, it is very doubtful, and I believe this is a moot point, since the amount of cars in the world and fuses they produce is inadequetly bigger, at least 100000 times bigger I presume, and since many of those cars are cheap, old and are being used by people in 3rd world countries, where the quality of fuel leaves a lot to be desired, I believe that there are a lot of dangers to our atmosphere aside from air travelling.

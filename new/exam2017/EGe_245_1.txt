By looking at the graph we can notice that difference between maximum and minimum temperatures in both cities is not dramatic, but pretty noticable at the same time.

It is easy to observe that climat in Brazil is much softer and comfortable than in Yakutsk, Russia.

According to the graph we can also make a conclusion that the difference between average maximum amd minimum temperatures in Brazil usually doesn't get wider than 8 degrees.

The difference between minimum and maximum temperatures is not that obvious during winter season; for example it is only about 5 7 degrees in January and December.

To sum up, the difference between maximum amd minimum temperatures stays practicaly the same whole year in Brazil, while it changes dramatically from season to season in Yakutsk.

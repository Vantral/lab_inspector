 From one hand it is better for economics inside the country to produce food and products only for their population, because it is support small businesses in that area and will improve them that in the future country could rise the whole economy.

I do not agree with this part of the staytment, because sometimes country just can not produce fresh food for all population and it gives more import from another country to support them.

In my opinion, countries should improve their economic inside by producing more food for themselves.

I disagree that countries should aim to import as little as possible, because sometimes they can do this because of the climate or another difficulties.

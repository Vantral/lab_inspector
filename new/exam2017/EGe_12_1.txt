It is evident from the chart that the number of white citizens outnumbers those of non-whites in both the general and the prison population in the UK, whereas in the USA the part of non-whites staying in prison is approximately twice as large.

It should be pointed out that the overall number of the non-white population in the USA makes up a notable part.

It is worth mentioning that in the UK the non-white constituent of prison population is twofold bigger than that of the general population.

Taking all the data into consideration, it can be noted that the non-white population in the USA seems to be prevalent, while in the UK the population mainly consists of whites.

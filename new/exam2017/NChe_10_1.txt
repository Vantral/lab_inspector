In this description will be given information fron two diagrams : Goods transported by rail, Goods transported by road.

Machinery is not so valuable for rail transportation, that is why it is 12% of rail logistics.

The lowest part ofrailtransportation is separated by three goods : Chemicals (11%), Non-metallic minerals (<11%), Food products (11%).

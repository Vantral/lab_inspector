In other words, young people have enough time to do whatever they want, which sometimes includes getting into "wrong" companies of friends, who can rob or attack innocent people just for the sake of fun.

Another reason of the described trend of more crimes committed by the young age group people might be as follows : current media produce a lot of content which is connected with cruelty, and young adults become more tolerant to crimes by wathing such content.

For instance, news agencies often try to show some awful and scaring videos from the places of accidents such as airplane crushes, car accidents or terrorist attacks.

In order to tackle the above-mentioned causes of the problem, I would, firstly, suggest creating multiple hobby clubs at schools, so that pupils could have a variety of things to do in their free time.

Evidently, this measure would be even more effective, if school students had an obligation to attend at least several hobby clubs.

As for the cruel content on TV and on the Internet, it can be wise to put more age restrictions on it.

However, it is necessary to keep in mind the possibility of an opposite effect which in that young people might get angry, if they are prohibited to watch something.

I believe that such effect can be avoided, if both mentioned measures are implemented, because then young people will not have time to try to watch prohibitted content.

To sum up, it is necessary to emphasize that the problem can be effectively addressed only if a combination of techniques is used.

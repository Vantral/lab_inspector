The presented two pie charts give the proportions of goods transported by rail and road in Eastern Europe during the year 2008.

 To begin with, it clearly can be seen that a big proportion in both ways of transportation consists of manufactured goods.

Thus, they take about 25% in rail transport and 28% in road transport.

However, there are some differences between these ways.

Firstly, the percentage of metals which is transported by rail is much higher than the same metal transported by road with 35% and 11% respectively.

In contrast, food products take about 30% in road transport and just 11% in rail one.

 As for other goods, they take approximately the same proportion, about 12 16 each.

However, noticable fact is that machinery goods transported by road take only 2%, that is the lowest number among all.

 To conclude it all, the most obvious fact is that metal goods are on the first position in the rail transport, while food products take the first place in the road transportation.

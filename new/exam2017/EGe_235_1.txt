So,there are a lot of metals, which is tranported by rail.

It takes 35 percent.

The third place is machinery.

There are 12 percent.

The fourth place have chemicals and food products and the last place have non-metallic minerals.

Secondly, there are a lot of goods, which transported by road.

Food products are the most popular products for road transporting.

The second place are manufactured goods.

Chemicals take 16 percent, non-metallic minerals take 13 persent and matals take 11 percent.

Here machinery is on the last place.

So, here we can see that the first place is different on the rail and on the road, the second place take manufactured goods on the all graps and third, fourth and other places are different.

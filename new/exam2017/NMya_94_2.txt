Many persons think that all countries must produce just for own population and don'd import it.

It is very nessesary and difficult problem.

And I will try to analyse it.

This quastion have positive and negative points, so it is hard to say that this idea is right or wrong.

But I will analyse two sides of this quastion.
<But CJC><I PNP><will VM0><analyse VVI><two CRD><sides NN2><of PRF><this DT0><quastion NN1><. SENT>@
At first, economic of countries, which export the food, very influenced by other countries, which import the food.

And if one country stop to import some goods from exporter country, then economic of this country will decrease.

But it is may not influence on importer country.

I think this solution may be positive for economic situation of this country.
<I PNP><think VVB><this DT0><solution NN1><may VM0><be VBI><positive AJ0><for PRP><economic AJ0><situation NN1><of PRF><this DT0><country NN1><. SENT>@
But this idea has other side.
<But CJC><this DT0><idea NN1><has VHZ><other AJ0><side NN1><. SENT>@
I think that it is possible to say about two nessesary negative aspects of this solution.
<I PNP><think VVB><that CJT><it PNP><is VBZ><possible AJ0><to TO0><say VVI><about PRP><two CRD><nessesary AJ0><negative AJ0><aspects NN2><of PRF><this DT0><solution NN1><. SENT>@
One of this aspects is problems of country, when it can't produce many food, that their own population eats.

It can be involved with climat or other reason.
<It PNP><can VM0><be VBI><involved VVN><with PRP><climat NN1><or CJC><other AJ0><reason NN1><. SENT>@
So, importing the food is the one possible solution for this countries.

Other negative aspect is possible influencing on friendship between two countries.

And consiguanters will be negative.
<And CJC><consiguanters NN2><will VM0><be VBI><negative AJ0><. SENT>@
It is also big problem, becouse it will can involve to importing country in the future.
<It PNP><is VBZ><also AV0><big AJ0><problem NN1><, PUN><becouse NN1><it PNP><will VM0><can VM0><involve VVI><to PRP><importing VVG><country NN1><in PRP><the AT0><future NN1><. SENT>@
But I sure that this negative outcome can be not nessesary, if importer stop import during some time.
<But CJC><I PNP><sure AJ0><that CJT><this DT0><negative AJ0><outcome NN1><can VM0><be VBI><not XX0><nessesary AJ0><, PUN><if CJS><importer NN1><stop NN1><import NN1><during PRP><some DT0><time NN1><. SENT>@
To sum up, I sure, that this idea can be alive and also some countries may follow it.

But goverments of this countries must understand that this stategy will make some negative outcomes.

According to the statistics presented at the graph, it is possible to divide six named regions into two groups.

The first group consists of the regions where the unemployment rate remains flat and no changes are observed during two years.

The second group deals with the regions where there are some changes.

For instance the unemployment rate in the Middle East drops from 11 per cent in 2014 to 9,6 per cent in 2015.

and this is the most significant decrease among all presented regions.

The same process is observed in Latin America and only in EU the rate jumps for 0,4 per cent in 2015.

The statistics below marks positive trend in unemployment rate, thus only EU suffers from its increase from 7,5% to 7,9% in 2015.

And internet piracy is a theft, because hundred millions dollars, that creators can borrow, are lost and people gets this arts for free But there is another opinion : if producers and musicans want their arts to be famous, especially music composition, then they have to share it everywere, including internet.

But, I disagree with punishment for Internet piracy, because anyway it helps producers and musicans to make their arts famous and after that to earn money on concerts and live-shows.

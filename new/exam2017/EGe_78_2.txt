However, a "Guaranteed Basic Income" system needs a lot of money, which government will take from the budget.

As a result, we have a lot of risks that the economy will go done immediately.

It is important to understand the basis of work of our basic economic system and take into account that the balance is much better variant for the country itself.

In conclusion, it is obvious that the system of guaranteed basic income has a majority of advantages for people's level of life but still it doesn't outweigh the disadvantages it has because of risks.

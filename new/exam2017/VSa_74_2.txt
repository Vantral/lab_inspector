On the other hand, just as any criminal can change and be the normal member of society, sportsmen who were cought on doing drugs should be given a chanse to change their attitude to sport.

So, according to this, we can't know if someone used drugs by his will or not, so punishment should not be permanent.

To sum up, I'd like to say, that there is no doubt that using illegal drugs is a serious crime in sport, but we can't ban people permanently without knowing every aspect of their situation, which is impossible.

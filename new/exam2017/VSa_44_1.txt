It can be seen that he biggest part of railway transportation was taken by metals with 35% while the second chart shows the food production was the biggest part and accounts for 30%.

The most distinguishing feature of the first chart is that there is three times as many metals as in the second chart.

A different pattern is that there were approximately 3 times more food products transported by road than by rail.

As for machinery goods there were about 5 times more machinery transported by rail in comparison to road transportation with 12% in former and 2% in the latter chart.

The overall view of the charts shows that metals and and machinery prefered to be transported by rail while food products were transported by road.

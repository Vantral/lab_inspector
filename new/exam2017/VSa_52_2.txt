Whilst some people argue that being caugh with using doping means exclusion from the sport field forever, other more loyal group reckon that 2 years of ban would be enough.

Though this perspective it is more satisfective to ban sportsmen, using illegal drugs, till the end if their lives.

Moreover, when we are talking about sport, we should not put a ban forever, because it is about human nature to use all the methods to achieve the goal.

From this perspective, we can agree that banning for 2 years is enough for a sportsman to analyse mistakes and become more successful in fair sports.

It seems to me that, firstly, we shouldn not prevent people from sport forever after one mistake, but using doping twise must lead to forever ban.

Secondly, I suppose it would be fair to discharge some points from a country, whose sportsman is using doping.

In this way, it would become more fair and other sportsmen won't rist in using illegal drugs.

To sum up, I would like to say that although ban is a good way of punishment, it must not be a forever one after one mistake.

Moreover impose punishment like discharging points on all country would work more efficiently.

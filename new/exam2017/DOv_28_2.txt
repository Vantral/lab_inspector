As every change in punishment system, growth in number of crimes commited by young people could be caused either by law changes (or new, law enforcement tendency) or changes in population behaviour.

As for Russia, we could see rapid growth in number of drug addicts, which are usually young.

The second main causation of this development is transformation of family institutions : traditional family is rare, so young people have less control over them and lack of socialization opportunities.

As young people have too much free time and no duties at all, they start drinking alcohol, use drugs and take part in crime activities.

Another reason of those crimes is lack of opportunities.

As young people have no job and no money they start stealling money.

We should help them to find jobs or provide them with enough money to live : this would also costs much, but at least won't cause a danger of crime.

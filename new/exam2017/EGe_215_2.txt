Throughout ages British and American films were thought to be the best not only in the UK or in the USA, but also in other countries all over the world.

Nowadays a lot of people continue to appreciate these films much more in comparison to their locally produced ones.

However, it remains unclear if there definitely are enough reasons to think that British and American films are exactly better that films from other countries.

Firstly, there are special film industries in the UK and in the USA, especially in the USA, which have much more money and opportunities than these industries in other countries.

Consequently, the films that were produced there are of a better quality and have more elaborated visual effects.

Moreover, advertising plays a big role in British and American films being more widespread than locally produced ones.

However, locally produced films often do not have enough money to spend on advertising and due to this fact a lot of peole just do not know about them.

Having said this, I would like to add that in spite of the fact that locally produced films are not good in the financial side of making a film, they have enough people resources.

In conclusion, I believe that government should take action on supporting local film industries and promoting their films.

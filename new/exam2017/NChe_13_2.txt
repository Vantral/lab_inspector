In this essay I will disscus some of those problems, and will try to find a solution to reduce the harm out of these problems.

While using our smartphones people are affected by radioactive impulses wich destroy our brain system, and eaven could lead to canser.

However, there is a solution out of this problem and it is special phone case which reduse the harm from radioactive waves.

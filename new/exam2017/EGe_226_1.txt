Mostly the rail is used to deliver metals that take 35 percents of the total amount and manufactured goods that take 25 percents of the total amount.

So, these two categories occupate more than a half of the whole rail traffic.

At the same time, 28 percents of road traffic is taken for the same manufactured goods.

That means the both ways are quite equally comfort and popular for manufactured goods' transportation.

Also, road is mainly used for food products' transportation that occupate 30 percents of the whole road traffic.

Unlike manufactured goods, food products only take 11 percents of the total amount of goods transported by the rail.

Chemicals has pretty similar percents of transportation by rail and by road as manufactured goods - 11 percents and 16 percents.

Opposaly, machinery takes 12 percents by road against 2 percents by road.

And the last category non-metallic minerals occupes less than 10 percents in amount transportated by rail and 13 percents in amount transportated by road.

The conclusion is that the rail is mostly used for haivy metal products' transportation and the road is mostly used for food and light products' transportation.

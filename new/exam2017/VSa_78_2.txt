The issue concerning the use of drugs which are prohibited among the sportsmen elicits a lot of controversy today.

People who tend to punish sportsmen for the rest of their lives point out to this fact and label accused athletes as "crimers" with a "psychology of a crimer".

This means that such sportsmen will in any case try to repeat this illegal experience and, what is more, in a more complicated way, taking previous "mistakes" into account.

I full-heartedly support the idea that athletes should not be punished forever, as there is one more serious argument for such a stance.

Sometimes, sportsmen even do not know about the drugs they consume as their coaches add them into the food an athlete eats.

To conclude, I would like to stress that although those sportsmen who let themselves use illegal drugs are breaking the law and must be punished for this, there is no sense in full-life banning them from sport as they can realise their mistakes and continue their carrier in an hones way and there are also different factors described in this essay which should be taken into consideration (technical mistakes, for instance)

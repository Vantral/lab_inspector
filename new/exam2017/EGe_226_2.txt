There are many political and social programms to reduce crime and people have differents points of view about steps to be taken for reducing crime.

Many of them suppose that the increase of prison sentences could help.

However, others do not agree with them and think that there are better ways to solve the problem.

The arguments in protection of the position "longer prison sentences" are clear.

Firstly, the long hard sentence as a punishment would make a potential criminal think twice before commiting a crime.

However, even if the crime and the punishment would be uncomparable this step wouldn't have any result with dangerous people as maniacs etc.

Secondly, The good argument is that as long the criminal keep being in prison as long the citizens are protected from him.

This will make people feel safe.

But at the same time the long sentence

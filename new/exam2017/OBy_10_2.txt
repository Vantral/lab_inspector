If we know that long-term using can lead to some problems, we should use it less even if we do not want to do it.

Second, we should always read instructions from creators of technology in order to know all possible cases and the ways of their solving.

 Thus, technology may has bad influence on our health, but it is only our responsibility to control the number of influence.

As a result, they do not know what is good, and what is bad, and this group of children may become a small gang when they realize that there is easier to receive money by robbing than by legal ways.

The lack of parents' attention can be replaced by Internet and videogames, and the child learns new knowledge about violence, drugs or something like that very quickly but without right explanation And it can also create the wrong set of values and lead him to become a criminal.

However, not only parents but school teachers can make their influence on this issue : for instance, they can teach children not only math and language, but also about how to socialize and become a righteous citizen.

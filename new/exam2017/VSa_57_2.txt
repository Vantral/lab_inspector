Some people think, that it would be fair to ban sportsmen, who use steroids, for not very long period.

On the one hand, it is honestly to ban athlet from sport for not very long period, because time for professional is very matter, so 2 years can cost for him as 20 years.

Moreover, if person cheated and than caught, it is not very significant how many years he will be banned, because for all people he will be cheater forever.

For instance, professional boxer John Jones, who was caught in 2016 for using steroids now for most people and his fans is only cheater.

On the other hand, athletes who use illegal drugs to improve their results in sport should be punished more strict, than, for example, 2 years.

Furthermore, they should be not only banned, but they must excluded from all sport's salaries and his or her own achievments in sport.

For example, teammate of Usein Bolt, which was caught by using illegal drugs was not only bannes, but excluded from gold medal, which he received in 2004 year.

In my opinion, the person who was caught by using steroids must be banned at least for 5 years.

I think it is fair punishment for crime, like this.
<I PNP><think VVB><it PNP><is VBZ><fair AJ0><punishment NN1><for PRP><crime NN1><, PUN><like PRP><this DT0><. SENT>@
At the same time, I believe, that all people which were caught should be put under research of special comission, because sometimes, sportsmen's haters can put some drugs in his food or water.
<At PRP><the AT0><same DT0><time NN1><, PUN><I PNP><believe VVB><, PUN><that CJT><all DT0><people NN0><which DTQ><were VBD><caught VVN><should VM0><be VBI><put VVN><under PRP><research NN1><of PRF><special AJ0><comission NN1><, PUN><because CJS><sometimes AV0><, PUN><sportsmen NN2><'s POS><haters NN2><can VM0><put VVI><some DT0><drugs NN2><in PRP><his DPS><food NN1><or CJC><water NN1><.

So, it is reasonable to say, that, comission should find them, who did this crime.

I cant deny an admirable idea to ban cheaters from sport for the rest of their lives, but I think, it is too crusial to do it, because it can be a mistake.

One can't deny that technology has changed the world that we live in for good over just a few decades.

It has become an essential part of our lives, something we can't have fun of communicate without, but is it really all that good or are there downsides to us using so much of it all the time?

One of the issues that has come to the attention of many with the rise of technology is that it can sometimes cause problems with health and the number of those problems is increasing all the time.

 For instance, due to the nature of the screens that are now a part of almost any technological device and also because of people staring at them for many hours every day, many have started to feel that their eyes tire fasted than usual and because of that the number of problems with eyesight has increased dramatically.

 Another thing that is worth our attention is that people slauch a lot while using computers and smartphones which causes posture problems that are difficult to treat.

One of the ways in what the problem can be reduced is to mind our posture and the time we spend staring at our screens.

One should use a comfortable chair while working on computer and try to keep their face 30 40 centimeters from the screen.

Another way to deal with this issue is to do regular exercises for eyes and posture, for example, while having small 5 10 minute breaks.

This way our eyes and back won't tire so fast and we will at least have a chance of reducing the damage that technology causes to our health, although probably not eliminate it altogether.

All in all, technology is not something that is always good for us, but it doesn't mean that we can't deal with the problems it causes.

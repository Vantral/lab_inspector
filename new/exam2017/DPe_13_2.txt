Personally, I believe that illegal copying and sharing of works of any form of contemporary art should not be tolerated.

So, copying the materials illegally robs people of their legitimate money which they could have gained if a pirate has not opened an access.

However, I disagree that every person accused of illegal sharing deserves punishement.

So, it essentially means that because of pirate copying people prevent money from getting in those who played no part in creating the music or the film.

To conclude, I would like to stress that in order to find an efficient way solve the problem people should shift from punishing those who share the protected materials to thoroughly explaining those who download them why they should stop doing that.

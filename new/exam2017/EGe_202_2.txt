Some people think that it is more important to spend money on solving social problems such as poverty or environmental issues than on space exploration and others have an opposite opinion.

It is more urgent because space exploration can help scientists to get some new knowledges about the environment on the Earth.

Space exploration also means that the science is good developed.

This factor is very important, because it shows that we are not just human beings, but the people, who can think and develope.

Finally, space exploration is highly important and it is neccessary to spend money on developing it.

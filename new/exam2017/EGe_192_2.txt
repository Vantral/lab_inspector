On the one hand, British and American film industries are more popular because of the financial support, which the government gives them.

As we can see if film has the best actors and good equipment, it means that film has a good financial support.

For example, if film industries want to see popular actors playing in their films, actors should have a good salary for this job.

Moreover, if they want to have a good camera or place, where the film will be, they also should have a money to rent it.

On the other hand, many people all over the world like superheroes or stories, which are more closely for their interests or unreal lifes.

It is obviously, that if we want to forget about our problems, we can go to the cinema and watch the movie about Spider-man or X-men.

Watching these films we can go away from the real life.

So, film industries, which have a good financial support have a chance to help us to solve our problems, whereas local film industries cannot.

To sum up, I want to say that it is important to film industries have a good finances to produce their films.

I claim that government should give more money to local film industries, if they really want to have their own popular film makers and actors.

I disagree that countries only need to produce the food for their own population.

 First of all, export is a large part of budget for particular every country.

And export of food can bring much profit to the government.

 And the second, not every country can produce as much products to their own population, Rich countries can help them.

In the other hand, government don't need to produce food only for export because in that case bisuness in that country can slowly down.

Finally, we don't need to remember that not every kind of food country can produce.

Some of product can be produced in only hot climate, some only in middle-term countries, and food export can help take all of kind to all countries.

Summarise all of that, I want to say that developing product for other countries are important such and produce them to their own population.

The growing crime rates are the topic of ubiquitous concern nowadays, and the situation is only aggravated by the fact that more and more young individuals are being engaged in this malicious process.

Firstly, the increasing level of juvenile deliquency can be explained by the amount of freedom, granted to people in general.

Less severe gun control policies and the abolition of capital punishment in many states question the authority of the government for the common people.

So the increase in question may show not the rise in murders, but in rather less serious mischiefs, like, for instance, smoking in public places.

And the growing proportion of the young people here can be explained by the absence of true crime in the eyes of young criminals, which, so to say, legalize such actions.

All in all, we should not jump the gun and blame violent films and videogames for the growing juvenile deliquency, as it is mainly the guilt of the system and people's nature, that nudges the youngsters towards mischief.

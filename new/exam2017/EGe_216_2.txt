Some people suppose that the air trips follow to air pollution and global warming but the atmoshere should be saved and so the government should reduce all flights.

On the other hand, there is opinion that the cause of such pollution is not only plans but also fabrics because they create a lot of bad gases.

Moreover, cars and bus do more pollution than the plans and so the road kinds of transport are worse than the plans.

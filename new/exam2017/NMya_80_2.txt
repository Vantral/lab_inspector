Some people suppose that countries must produce the food that their own population eats by itselves and should decrease import of food.

On the one hand there are many advantages produce enough food for population.

Of course, it is very good then noone can manipulate you by food prices, but also you can sell the food which your population didn't eat.

There are two kind of this countries : first kind is poor countries which can't produce or import enough food for population - like countries in Africa, second kind is developing or developed countries which could get enough food.

Very often countries which import food are more developed than countries which exports food.

In my opinion that countries don't need to produce food by themselves because many citizens of this countries work not in real sector, but in financial or science capacitive sectors, like in Swetzerlang.

The solution depends on many factors and something which could be good for Russia at the same time could be bad for Hong Kong.

On the one hand, we can say that metal is more popular, than other goods, but second chart illustrate that the amount of metals transported by road is extremely smaller than metals transported by rail and takes only 11% by all goods transported by road.

However, percent of manufactured goods transported by rail is similar to percent of manufactured goods transported by road.

Also a big feature is near food products, because percent of food transported by rail is smaller than percents of food transported by road.

Based on this information, we can make a conclusion that the most popular goods, which are transported by rail is some manufactured goods and metal, and a car make transportation of food products even often.

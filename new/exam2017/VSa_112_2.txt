The main argument of the second view is that the cruelty of this measure contributes to stop any drug actions in sport.

Personally I agree with the stronger punishment because it promotes a fall in drug's market and will finally disappear.

Moreover, people think that sportsmen must be banned for a limited period because all people make mistakes and they can change.

In my opinion, limited period is more humanly, and it is great, however, I am in favour that this problem must be soluted at once.

In addition, people for limited punishment think that only one mistake would be a reason to inability to develope of sport sphere because lots of talented sportsmen could not take part in competitions.

Nevertheless, people for strong punishment think that sport sphere will develope more efficently and without any troubles.

I strongly agree with it!

In conclusion, as much as the limited period as a punishment may sound in humanism tradition only the conjunction of strong measures could help to tackle this problem.

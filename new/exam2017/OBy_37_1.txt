Overall, food products made up a tangible 30% in transportation by road whereas in transportation by rail metals represented the highest percentage of 35%.

As can be seen from the pie charts, machinery goods are more likely to be transferred by rail than by road.

As for non-metallic minerals, the quantity of these goods in by road transportation is significantly bigger than in by rail one.

Furthermore, manufactured goods and food products make the major part of transportation by road whereas in transportation by rail it is metals and manufactured goods together (35% and 25% respectively).

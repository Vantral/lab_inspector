These paraments have not changed during the year, in other regions, however, they did change insignificantly.

In the other two regions with the rate changes presented - Middle East and Latin America this numerical indicator fell from 11 to 9,6 and 6,8 to 5,8 consequently.

So, to summarise the information and to depict the results of the 2015 : South Asia has stable and low rates of unemployment, EU and Latin America rates are almost the same and fluctuate a little.

The Middle East rate is rather high, but tends to fall, and North Africa has the highes but stable unemployment rate.

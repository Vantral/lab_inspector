This point is the most important one for any film which was made to fascinate people all over the world, so we should not even compare the quality of such films.

In my point of view, we should use something which was never showed by somebody else and this way can help us become leaders in this small part of a huge cinema industry without comparing to western films with history which is so different from our one.

To sum up, I want to say that a financial support is necessary for the development of local film industries, but they should change the direction of the development of shooting.

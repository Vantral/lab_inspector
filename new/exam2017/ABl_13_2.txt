It is true, that we should punish people, who illegally copy and share films or music, because it is property and property rights should be protected strictly.

Therefore, if he dounloads file of something else, which is in open access on the internet for free instead of buying it for some amount of money (Modern films' and music album's cost is rather high, that is another reason why people dounload "pirate" content), should we blame him for rationality.

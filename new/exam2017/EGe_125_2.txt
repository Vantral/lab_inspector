There are a huge number of people who are crazy about watching sport.

Most of people have thair favourit sport team who they support through thik and thin.

But others say that it is just a waste of time.

There are arguments of both sides, however, which we will discuss here.

Personally, I agree with this statement.

Watching sport will not make us smarter or better.

It won't also inform us about something that we didn't know before.

So, because of this, I think that people can do something more useful for them instead watching sport.

Moreover, there are some sport fans who too keen on thair favourit team and it can lead to having an arguments with fans of another team.

However, some people can't agree with this.

They think that sport helps us to express our patriotic feelings because most of people support team from thair countries.

Furthemore, it can bring some people together.

Beeing crazy about sport can help people to find a new friends who have the same interests as they.

It is also a good way to have a rest after a difficult day.
<It PNP><is VBZ><also AV0><a AT0><good AJ0><way NN1><to TO0><have VHI><a AT0><rest NN1><after PRP><a AT0><difficult AJ0><day NN1><. SENT>@
In conclusion, I would like to point out that I can't see any useful things in watching sport but I don't have anything against it because every person has his own way of relaxing and there is not also anything harmful.

But, as for me, it is not my cup of tea and I would prefer reading or playing the guitar.

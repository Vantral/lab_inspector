There is two graphs that describes what maximum and minimum points temperature had reached in every month for the year.

The graphs illustrates dates in Russian city Yakutsk and brazil city Rio de Janeiro.

 Overall, the both lines of the first graph is riching pick stedialy and slowly falling down in contrast of the second graph that have not considerable changing from one temperature for the period.

 Firstly, the maximum line of Russian city begin with around -40*C.

And it is the most small point for that line as ending up point that is also around -40*C in December.

The maximum line of Brazil city begin with the maximum of that line is around 15*C.

The maximum of Yautsk line is around 20*C.

Next type of line have date that decrease almost in twice.

So the maximum of minimum of temperature in Yakutsk is around 10*C.

And the minimum is almost same like maximum line is around -40*C.

The next graph illustrate the minimum line equal maximum line.

We can see that the maximum pick is around 25*C and minimum is reach of July that is around 15*C.

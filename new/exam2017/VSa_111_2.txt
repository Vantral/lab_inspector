While people nowadays argue wether drug using athlets should be banned from professinal sport for the rest of their lives or not, I am going to introduce my own opinion on this topic and support my arguments with relevant examples.

Firstly, if we take a look on the statistics of violanting sport laws by using illigal drugs for today, we may see that it is rather common problem for all the countries and sport organisations.

Thus, banning athlets for using drugs from competing professionaly for a limited period does not solves the problem of the topic anyhow.

So this kind of punishment just does not help the modern sport.

On the contrary, total ban for a drug using professional sportsman, I believe, is required in most cases.

Why?
<Why AVQ><? SENT>@
For the two reasons.
<For PRP><the AT0><two CRD><reasons NN2><. SENT>@
One of them is that usage of illigal drugs during the professional sport activity is an extremely rude abuse of sport ethics.

And the final reason is that using different kinds of illigal drugs in proffesional sport just ruins the idea of objective competition by raising the results of drug-using sportsmen.

In conclusion, we should admit that using of illigal drugs is rude violation of sport law, so it must be strictly prohibited and sportsmen who violate this law absolutely must be banned from competing professionaly for the rest of their lives in order not to allow such problem of the modern sport occure anymore.

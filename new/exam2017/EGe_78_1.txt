It is clear that the first graph shows how the population of the USA has changed from 1750 till 2000.

The second one is dedicated to the birth and death rate during the same period of time.

As we can notice at the first graph the population of the USA began to rise up from 1800 and razed gradually till 2000.

What is more, it is pluses by each 50 years for a about a half of hundred people.

It is clear that from 1700 till 1800 two lines were going together and they were at high level, so the amount of births and deaths were the same.

Then in 1950 we can see that the birth rate boomed up; however the death one remained stable.

It is undeniable that these two graphs have something in common.

When there was a boom in births, the line of population was going up.

But it is important to consider that this was because of many factors, one of such is migration to country.

To sum up, these two graphs show changes in population which depend on level of birth and death too.

It has been widely discussed in recent years whether is it relevant to reduce the number of air flights or not.

To begin with, one convincing argument in favor of air travel is that this type of transport does not play a key role in evnironmental pollution.

This confirms that air travel is better to be more popular than other transport, in case it is less harmful for nature and our planet.

Global warming and air pollution (as well as water pollution) are international problems, which shoud be solved by all counties.

And since air travel is one of the reasons of our planet's damage, some people claim that the most part of it should be canceled.

This idea seems doubtful because it implies that communication between countries (and, later, international relations) would be more complicated.

There are heavy industries and a lot of factories in almost every country of the world, which pollute nature and cause global warming too.

One of them is to make air flights even more popular, because they hurt our planet less than cars do.

But I strongly believe that the amount of air travel should not be reduced, because this action will only make the international communication more complex, while environmental problems would not be solved.

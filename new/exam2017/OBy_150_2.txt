 I can agree with statement that countries need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible.

 It is easy to understand that it is excellent way to give food to all your population.

Second reason is economical and food stability, when other countries have less influence to out country and it gives us something like shield.

My version of organization food politics is decreasing import as possible and increasing export.

Decreasing import gives us safe and stable future, where country can avoid global economical problem.

On the other side, export gives country money (not only that because gold is the way too) and make the nation rich.

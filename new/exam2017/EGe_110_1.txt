However, it is obvious that the network is mostly used by the younger generation.

The same trend can be noticed with Instagram, which is most frequently used by the youngest age group.

LinkedIn, on the other hand, is most popular among people from 30 to 64 years old.

This can be explained by the different needs of each generation, with LinkedIn being more of a business social network, unlike Facebook or Instagram, which are used mostly for socializing and entertainment.

Overall, it is obvious that the social networks one uses depend on one's age and needs corresponding to it.

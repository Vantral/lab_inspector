There has been much debate in recent times wheather should we spent as much money as we do to research space or we should not.

We can find there something special, that we do not have here in our planet.

For instance, some alternative resourses, which could make our lifes easier in some ways.

Also, here is already 7 milliards of people on our planet and we need more space to live.

Space researchers try to find at least one more planet where we could survive.

We know that this job is very dangerous, so workers (researches) have a big salary and equipment is also very expensive.

On the other hand, we definitely spend a lot of money on it.

It will be better if explorers could make this process cheaper, but it is not the case that all saved money will be spent to solve invironmental problems.

Otherwise, there will be payed much more attention on solving them and may be we will help our planet and our nature keep well.

To sum up, I would like to say that researches try to find another place to live, meanwhile we can not save this one and only, which is very important - it is our planet.

We have to pay attention on its health more than on the space.

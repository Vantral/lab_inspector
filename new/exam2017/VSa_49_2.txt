In spite of the fact of a serious crime, nobody can get a future career, wins and success of other person - if this crimer will be a good sportsman without drugs, he can take part in international competitions, when he wants it.

Taking everything into accaunt, I can conclude, that athlets should be banned for a limited period, because ban for all life can get from person suceess and his favourite profession on all life - noone can do it.

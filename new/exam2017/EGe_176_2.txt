To begin with, I really think that exploring outer space is definitely among those features that lead us to a never-ending progress.

Staying at the track of contraversary, I would like to introduce the reasons why certain kind of space exploration really appears to be some kind of a waste.

I tend to think that huge investment needs to be backed up with the reality and the key point is that such kind of investment is obliged to be atleast useful not speaking of effectiveness.

As I've already mentioned, space exploration appears to be a leading power for human progress of enormous strength.

Exploring space may lead to inventing tons of different things we are everyday in need for.

For example inventing new kinds of meds, new sources of energy, recieving some explanations of how the life works on our planet.

So, basically, by investing into scientific cosmos exploration we are to move forward in our progress which, as for me, would undoubtedly lead to increase of the quality of life.

And improving overall quality of life is another crucial feature of scientific space investment especially when speaking of much important downearth I've mentioned above.

The majority of such problems could be solved by means of improving quality of life or for example inventing new energy sources.

To sum everything up, I tend to somehow agree with the statement given in terms of the reasons of space exploration and it's relevance for downearth reality.

That is to say, that we are to carefully take into account our needs and abilities before entering the space and spending insane sum of money.

We are to focus on whats relevant for today and hence we are to invest in such fields and, as for me, scientific space exploration is an excellent opportunity for reaching our goals, mostly, for progressing and improving the quality of life.

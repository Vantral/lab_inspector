It can be deduced from the charts that many types of goods were transported by rail as successfully as by roads in 2008.

Namely, the amount of chemicals delivered by trains was only 5% lower than one by trucks : 11% and 16% respectively.

Trains were also more preferable for transporting metals : approximately three-time more metals were transported by them - 35%, when only 11% were moved with the help of trucks.

Speaking about non-metalic minerals,it can also be noticed, that they were moved more often with the help of trucks than with the help of trains.

Overall, after analyzing the information provided, it can be stated that these two means of transportation are equally popular, but for some type of good one semms to be more beneficial than the other.

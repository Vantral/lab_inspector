In this essay, I will outline some of the causes and possible solutions to the problem.

The two primary causes of the issue are video games and movies.

Nowadays video games often feature scenes of rampant violence, gore, blood and other disturbing elements.

In the 90s, a video game called Doom was released on the market, which soon became very popular.

The game featured first-person view shooting and killing with lots of blood.

Soon after, a young man committed rampage at school, claiming that he wanted to replicate the game in real life.

This serves as an important example to the fact that games may cause young people to follow a crime path.

Moreover, movies and especially Sci-Fi films are becoming even more realistic than before.

There is an abundance of action films, thrillers, horrors that all feature killing people, mutilation, going over the limits.

What is disturbing that this is often shown as if it were easy to accomplish, naturally offering children and adolescents an example.

In other words, the causes lie in the incessant flow of violence from games and movies which trigger the desire to try this in real life.

Some of the possible solutions to this problem include restricting video games and movies and promoting lawful behaviour.

Video games and movies could be restricted by age groups, so that games and movies that are only permitted to adults would only be allowed with parental supervision.

For example, a game rated 18+ would only be allowed to adults or children with adult supervision, provided that adult consider the game appropriate.

It is also paramount that there be increased teaching and promotion of lawful behaviour.

Schools should teach their students to obey the law and to think their actions thoroughly.

Penal code should be taught at schools, so that young people know what could follow if they decide to act against the law.

To conclude, the two causes that raise the issue of increased crime rate are violent video games and movies, which may be solved by imposing age limits on games, movies and promoting lawful behaviour.

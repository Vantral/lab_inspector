Firstly, it is seen from the graphs that different kinds of goods were mostly transported by different means.

The portion of chemicals transported by rail was accounted for 11% and its percentage of goods transported by road was 16%, that is almost equal to the first one.

Portion of food product was a third of overall goods transported by rail and portions of metals and non-metallic minerals were almost equal.

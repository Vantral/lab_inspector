Moreover there are usually coaches responsible for giving them a medicine, so banning athlete permanently may simply ruin his life for no reason, while the real guilty person walks free.

So letting those people compete again may be dangerous for their lives causing some accidents during the competition or simply dishonest.

To sum up, there is no certain way of dealing with such a controversial question, as both positions present rather convincing arguments, which have to be studied more closely.

The positive affection on their body may actually be present, but not in the way those sportsmen would become unbeatable, so it isn't actually cheating.

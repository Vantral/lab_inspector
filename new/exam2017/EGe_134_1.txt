Graphs provide us information about changes in population size, birth rate and death rate in the USA from 1750 till 2000.

Firstly, as it is shown in the first graph, the population in the USA started its slow growth since 1750 up to 1850.

Then the increase rate rises gradually up to 1950, so that population of the USA doubles from 75 million to 150 million people.

Finally the highest population growth dates from 1950 till 2000, as population again becomes nearly twice as big as it was.

Describing the second graph, throughout the whole history of the USA Birth rate has been always higher than the Death rate.

The difference between them was about 5 to 15 people per 1000.

Moreover, both rates have steadily risen from 1700 till 1800 and then fallen till 1950, when their behavior started to differ, as Birth rate increased a bit and Death rate stayed the same.

Summing up information from these two graphs we can discover that the population of the USA increased not due to the high birth rate but rather due to immigration from the other countries.

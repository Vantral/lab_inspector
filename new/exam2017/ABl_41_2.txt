Firstly, from my point of view, copying and sharing music or films breaks the private property rule but, in my opinion, the main reason why do people do illegally, is that the price for songs and films is too high.

So, if the producers want to get more money, they should cut the prices, which will increase the demand on illegal production.

So, I think, that punishing people is too strict because there are checks and balances which are able to solve this problem of pirate copies.

Secondly, I suppose that the other matter is that the internet-security is working not effective enough.

It is so because we can all view that all these pirate programmes have a free access.

If the state would have taken more actions in these aspects, we, just, couldn't have found these files which would have lead to buying license disks because this would have been the only source.

So, as a result, the prices would stay on the same level and the demand will be realning new peats.

This way helps to increase amounts or creators monty and at the same time it is not quiet radical because there is no necessity to punish people.

In conclusion, I would like to say that this problem is very difficult and the interests of civilians and businesmen are both important and the ways which were described earlier present themselves a compromise between too radical decisions.

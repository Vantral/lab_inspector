The first diagramm show that minimum temerature in Yakutsk is much lower, then maximum temperature.

And in Russian city temperature has increase from January to July, after that it has go down and hit a low in December.

As it's clearly seen, increase and decrease of temperature has surely character, and changes in amount of graduces is so fast.

Nowdays a lot of people think that countries should try to produce an food by themselves and import as little as possible.

To my mind, from one hand, producing food makes countries more independant.

They do not need to be in good relationships with other countries and depend on their prices on food.

Secondly, in this case goverment should not pay extra payments for transfering the food, and it of caurce makes the food much cheaper and available for all people.

And finally, this appoach creates thousands of job offers, develops the infrostructure and makes fermers richer.

This is very good for countries economics.

But on the other hand, in my opinion, trying not to import at all is not a good desition.

I strongly believe that there are always somthing that cannot be planted by a country by itself or it is much cheaper to import this thing.

The reasons for import may be different.

Some times the strong climate does not allow to grow some kinds of plants or may be it is just impossible to grow enough food for the population of the country.

So, to summ it all up I would like to say that althougn providing the population with food, grown in this country, is very usefull for countries economics and infrostructure, it does not mean that the goverment should try to import as little as possible because sometimes importing something may be more convinient and much cheeper than trying to grove it.

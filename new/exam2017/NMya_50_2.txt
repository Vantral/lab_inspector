Nowadays the problem of offending authors rights has become very essential and controversial as well.

It is often said that punishment has to be for both pirates and users.

But it is more frequently believed that downloading files for free do not have to be considered offensive.

 In my opinion, pirates have to be punished, but not users.

So I can only partially agree with the idea of punishment of authors rights breakers.

On the one hand, pirates activity is illegal as they are stealing music, films and other media products for free.

They break codes and download files for other people.

They are active in process of stealing so this kind of activity requires a punishment.

On the other hand, users constitute a passive side.

They are not stealing, they just take files that are already hacked and given for everyone for free.

Some of them do not even think about authors rights.

Also using pirate files is just a consequence caused by the pirate's activity.

there are too much people downloading illegal files to punish everyone.

In conclusion, I believe that hackers have to be punished, but taking files that are already given free and downloaded by others don't have to be considered illegal.

We just have to deal with the cause, but not with the consequences that already exist.

Solving the problem of hacking media files will automatically decrease the problem of illegal downloading.

But punishing everyone taking something that a lot of other people take has no sense, as we will have to deal with almost every human having access to the Internet.

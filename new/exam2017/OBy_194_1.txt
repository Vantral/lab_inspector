 Overall, the largest group of transported by rail are metals - 35%, while food products are preferred to transport by road more than other goods.

Food products and chemicals are in equal proportion - 11% and 12% of rail transportation contains machinery.

If we look at the chart of transportation by road in detail we can see that the largest group after food products is manufactured goods - 28%.

In contrast to rail, it is more convenient to transport chemicals and non-metallic minerals by road - 16% and 13% versus 11% and 6% of the first chart.

The proportion of machinery is the smallest - just 2%, that is why we can say that machinery is preferred to transport by rail.

First of all, it is clear most underground railway systems were opened in the XX century except the oldest one which was built in London in 1863 and the newest system among all which was built in Los Angeles in 2001.

Furthermore, it is obvious the oldest underground railway systems that were built in London, Paris and Tokyo have more kilometres of route (395, 199, 155 respectively) and more passengers per year (775, 1191, 1927 respectively) than other 3 underground railway systems that were built later.

More precise analysis reveals the fact that the oldest underground railway system which was built in London has the biggest number of kilometres of route (394 kilometres).

However, it is only third in the list of six cities considering the passengers per year number which is 775 for London, 1191 for Paris and 1927 for Tokyo.

Speaking about newer underground railway systems, it is noticable they have considerably less passengers per year with 144 millions in Washington DC, 45 millions in Kyoto and 50 millions in Los Angeles.

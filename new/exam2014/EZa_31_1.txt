On the graph it can be seen that in winter people consume almost twice as much electricity as in summer.

Demand for electricity is the lowest at night : 30000 units in winter and about 15000 units in summer.

The pie chart shows that the greatest quantity of energy is used for heating rooms and water - more than a half of all demand.

All in all it can be seen that people spend more electricity in winter, and it can be connected with the fact that most of the electricity is used for heating purposes.

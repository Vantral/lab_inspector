In the graph we can see how much electricity is used in England in winter and in summer per day.

Judging I can say that people in England are using more electricity in winter, the highest level of usage is between 21 and 24 hours, it is more than 40000.

Most of all people use electricity for heating, more than 50%.

Speaking about other aspects I can say that they are practically the same : 17,5% for ovens, kettles and washing machines, and the 15% for vacuum cleaners, food mixers and electric tools.

Speaking about comparison I should say that people use more electricity in winter per day than in summer per day for about 20000 units of electricity.

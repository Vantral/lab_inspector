As for me, I think that increasing sport facilities is not a good idea because if people do not have enough time for it he will not do sport and when government will build more gyms.

What is more, if people do not understand that if need for their health, that it is usefull and it helps to live for long time they do not want to do sports.

In conclusion, I should say, that if people do not want to do something in our case, do sport, different facilities do not help to improve public health.

Two bar charts illustrate information about the percentage of students of different age being motivated to study by career or interest and the percentage of learners of different age group who are given employer support.

Overall there is an obvious steep rise in the percentage of students studying for interest throughout the age group getting older.

The bar chart shows that students who are under 26 years old are mostly motivated to study for career, whereas for students who are over 49 years old the results are vice-versa - roughly 20 percent of students of that age are intended to study for career.

That is approximately four size less than the percentage of students under 26 studying for the same reasons.

As far as employer support is concerned, there is a slight fluctuation in the percentage of students who are given time-offs and help with fees.

The group of students who are under 26 years old show the highest score among other age groups - not less than 60 percent, whereas the lowest score is for students who are in their fourtees - approximately 30 percent.

To sum up, there is a clear tendency for the number of students studying for career to reduce within the time and a clear growth of the percentage of students studying for interest.

From the positive point of view it surely should because people will have much more opportunities for sport activities, more freedom in choosing the places to do sports.

In addition, many areas of even biggest countries have bumped into luck of facilities for sport nowadays, so it goes without saying that the pure countries have even more drastical problems in this field.

That is considered to be true to life due to the fact that lots of people todays are ignoring sport activities and the number of fasilities is not a reason why they do so.

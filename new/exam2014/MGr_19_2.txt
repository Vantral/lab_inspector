According to the speech of the main player of the film "The pursuit of happyness" happiness is the feeling when you get the most wanted things despite many difficulties you had in your past.

As can be seen it has almost the same meaning.

Therefore, I suppose that factors in getting happiness might be similar for many people and can be divided to external and internal.

According to my view, external factors may include having a home, car, high-paid loved work and family.

These factors are dependent not only from us, but also from others.

However, we cannot forget an internal factors like a healthy of our mind, our self-esteem, which are depended from us, bu the most difficulty changed.

In conclusion, I want to add that each definition of happiness is unique and individual and the steps of reaching happiness are changing due to its definition.

 As I think, happiness itself is undefineable, but everyone can answer about the feeling of being happy.

The best way to define what is happiness is to find out which thing make every single person feel good individually, so we will recognise that all the results are identical, but "trees of possible ways" are each unique.

So, these facts for me are begging the question about how to write any interesting ways about how to become happy if they may be not intersubjective?

For example, personally, I feel happy at all the different times in my life because I am sure that my family and the closest friends will always have a need in me.

The second factor is, at least, thinking that you have got a role, function in some sort of scheme because if puts on you responsibility for the whole organisation that gives some more things which you can use as triggers to continue living with full potential.

If you can feel with your own role in the world of society than the feeling of being unswapable would be settled strongly in your mind.

This feeling can be reached throughout understanding of nesessarity of things you do and the whole outer world, because when you feel yourself unswapable, you feel yourself in harmony with other people and the whole world.

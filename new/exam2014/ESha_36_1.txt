The charts below provide us information about differences between the ages of inhabitants of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and in 2050 based on predictions.

 As we can observe, the half of population of Yemen consisted of young people from 0 to 14 years old in 2000, while in Italy the amount of youngsters were remarkably lower (14,3% of population).

Moving on, it should be admited that the quantity of old people in Italy exceeded one in Yemen more than by 20% in 2000.

Next we should pay our attention to middle-aged population (people from 15 to 59 years old) in both countries.

In fact, this numbers were not so different because in each country the majority is often within this limits of age.

As for predictions, we can say that in the future the amount of middle-aged people is supposed to grow in Yemen, while according to the projections, we will observe the opposite phenomenon in Italy.

It is interesting that in both countries the quantity of teenagers is considered to fall down, especially in Yemen.

 To conclude, we can distinguish some common trend in population changes both in Yemen and in Italy.

That is reduction of young inhabitants and sharp growth of people who is elder than 15.

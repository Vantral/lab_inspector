However, there is an equal trend in both nationalities that older population will approximately double in 50 years.

It is also noticeable that the majority of residents will be represented by people of working age in both countries.

To summarise the facts described, we can conclude that even if there are some changes to be faced, the general picture will not change dramatically.

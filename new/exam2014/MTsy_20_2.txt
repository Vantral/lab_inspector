Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities.

Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.

The development of sport sphere and the providing of sport facilities avaliability are not effective methods of public health improving, and I am going to tell, why.

On the one hand, the variety of sports events can provide the public interest for sport, for some time.

Doing the sport activieties helps people to keep good physical form, so it can prevent organism from some deseases and make it more resistant to them.

On the other hand, if the propaganda of healthy lifestyle is forgotten and not developed, people will not even know about the positive sides of doing sport.

Also, there are many different ways of coming to healthy lifestyle, which can or cannot integrate to sport.

The many different sport facilities exist already and the quality of public health increases very low.

To conclude I would like to say, that providing increase in the number of sport facilies is the good way to improve publice health, but it is not enough.

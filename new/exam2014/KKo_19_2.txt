I suppose, that it would be better to include such service in high school activity.

First of all, I think that such type of social activity could help young people to improve their communicating skills and make their adaptation in society much easier.

The second reason why I support the necessarity of such community service is that young generation are best candidates for charity and helping old people and children.

When you are young and healthy, it's the best time to help other people and society in general to make their life better.

Also, free social activity will convince older people that young generation is not lost and able to give use to society.

But we should not only include such community service to high school programme, we also need to organize it right way.

Every school must organize it's pupils to groups which will do sociably-useful work.

Besides, those schools will be needed to make advertisement, to talk, for example, to old people and explain to them that excepting help from young people who work in such charity group, will help them to save money.

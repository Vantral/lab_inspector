For instance, a financial problem, which might well prevent a person from spending a gap year beneficially, as special courses and travelling, cost a lot of money.

Also, there might well be a problem with changing interests and requests during the year without studying, For example, being upset with his faults, when a subject is too difficult, a person can change his mind about becoming a programmer.

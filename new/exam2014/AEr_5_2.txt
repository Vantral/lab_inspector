Some people believe that creative artists should not be restricted or held up by the government and should express their emotions freely in any way they like.

On the one hand, if the government forbid artists to express themselves there would be no new emotional pictures, music or other works, because people will be afraid about the government and measures that can be done for them.

Art is also can not be controled by anyone else, because every person create in its own manner, if we do what he had been said it would not be art, it would be work.

If the art was somehow forbidden we wouldn't have seen such great imagies or poems like works of Salvador Dali or Picasso or poems of Esenin.

On the other hand, art nowadays is very expressive and there are too many agressive and dangerous things for mentality of society.

In my opinion, artists should not be restricted by the government to create, but the government should control what is shown on TV or in museums to society, especially children.

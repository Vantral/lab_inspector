By suppressing some views, government creates problems for itself as it is difficult to know whether the works of this author are popular or not because they are out of law.

So this sphere is regulated by rules of market and "unneccessary" works will dissappear itself without any demand.

To sum it all up, government shouldn't restrict rules for artists and break the freedom of expression as these measures just create some unneccessary problems for government and, what is more importante, art sphere may perfectly regulate itself without some limitations.

The truth is that a lot of people are too busy or lazy to visit gyms and do sports, so many would prefer to stop smoking and drinking alcohol, start eating more vegetables and fruits instead of making physical excercises.

There are a lot of ways that are implemented to make this way of life more popular : for example, government can increase people's awareness of healthy diets or even of anatomy and biology knowledges.

In my opinion, increasing the number of sports facilities is not the best way to make people healthier, because it is not convenient for everyone.

A healthy way of life consists of a lot other methodics that might be more convenient especially for busy people.

Instead of building sports gyms that will not be visited by people, government should popularise other ways of becoming healthier and stronger.

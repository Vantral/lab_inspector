Nowadays a problem of disproportion of sexes in universities is topical, but is it really necessary to accept an equal numbers of males a females in each subject, or it will be more preferable not to pay attention to this situation?

On the other hand, as I've already pointed out, the communication is an essentrial skill, which every student should imrove, but it doesn't mean, that this necessary skill should be practised at university.

This opinion could be presented on the example of special universities for males or females, which are wide spread in an English speaking counties a an educational level there is much higher, than in average university.

As a consiquence, I'd like to note, that the question of sexes disproportion in universities is strill open , but, as for me, this situation should be changed, in the way, of the whole ie section of mixed sexes universities.

However, it's passenger density is not the biggest and it is less than half of the same parameter of Tokyo, where the number of passengers per year reaches 1927 millions.

The city of Koyoto seems to be an outsider it this comparison, as it has only 11 kilometers of tracks and, on average, no more than 45 million passengers of this means of transport between European countries and United States of America.

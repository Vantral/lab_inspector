It is clear that persentage of elderely people tends to increase to approximately 25% between 1940 and 2040.

Looking through the graph analysed it can be noted that the number of people aged 65 and over has quite simillary changings in Sweden and USA through the period from 1940 to 2014.

These countries don't tend to have such significant increase as Japan has.

Namelly, amount of elderely people in Japan is rising from 5% in 1940 to about 27% in 2040.

The most dramatic rise can be detected throug the period between 2004 and 2040.

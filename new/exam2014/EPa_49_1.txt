As we can see in charts that represent Yemen in 2000 people in the age category 0 14 years consist more than a half of Yemen`s population.

As predicted in 2050 year in Yemen`s population will be a shift of 15 59 years old people and that category of population will become dominant.

In the Italy pie chart in 2000 year the population of middle age (15 59 years) is taking advantage of the other categories.

In the future prediction of 2050 year we can track the growth of the elderly category (60+ years).

This increase can be also a consequence of the improvement in standard of living.

Also we can admit that children popularity will fall up to 3%/ there are sagnificant decrease in percentage of 0 14 years future population in Yemen and incredible growth of elderly people (60+ years) in future of Italy.

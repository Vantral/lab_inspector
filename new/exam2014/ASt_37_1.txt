As the table shows, the oldest subway system is situated in London and the newest is located in Los - Angeles.

The next point of the table is total length of route in kilometers.

The biggest one is London subway (about 394 km) and the smallest one is situated in Koyoto (about only 11 km) so, Kyoto is an example which breaks coherence between age and total length.

But in general, all underground railway system which were opened earlier than 1989 had more the 100 km of total length of route.

Overall, the table shows the coheneinces between the age and the length of route between the length of route and number of visitors per year.

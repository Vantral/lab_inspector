The graph plainly indicates the number of consuming electricity during different seasons.

Moreover, the number of consuming electricity in summer war dropped in comparison with winter (it is between 10000 and 20000 in summer).

In fact, the graph also rallies from 12 to 15 hours, peaking in 20000 units of electricity also in summer.

The detailed view on the diagram reveals us, that more than half consuming energy is used for heating rooms and water.

The percentage of energy, consumed for lighting, TV and radio is the same as the percentage of energy, using for Vacuum cleaner and food mixers.

To sum up, we may notice that the huge number of energy is used for heating room is winter.

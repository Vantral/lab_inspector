It can be noticed that the biggest quantity of people aged 65 and over is in Japan, which starting from the decline from 5 per cent in 1940 to 3 per cent in 1960 and continuing with dramatical growth from 3 per cent in 1960 to 27 per cent by the end of the period.

Similarly, the proportion of population aged 65 and over shows the rise from 9 per cent in 1940 to 24 per cent in 2040, decreasing from 15 per cent in 1980 to approximately 14 per cent in 1995.

In contrast, the quantity of old people in Sweden steadily increases from about 7 per cent in 1940 to 26 per cent by the end of given period.

Overall, it can be stated after analyzing the information provided that the proportion of population aged 65 and over in Japan demonstrates the highest result, while the quantity of old people in Sweden and USA is followed by it.

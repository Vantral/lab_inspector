Family and friends help you and give a support when you need it.

For example, when a man have a good relationships with his family he become more self-confident and he knows that he would never be alone.

Moreover, friends are the family which we choose by ourselves, that is why friendships are necessary for a happy man.

Finally, having a good job and being a high-paid worker are very important for men too, because a good job gives the possibility to become a respected person, meanwhile money will give you the possibility to buy everything you want and make presents to family and friends.

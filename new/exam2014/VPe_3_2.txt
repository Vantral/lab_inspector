In recent years in some countries the tendency of having a gap-year becomes a very wide-spread.

Gap year it is a year between finishing high school and starting university studies, usually young people are working or travelling in this time.

On the one hand, some people consider that all youths should have a gap year.

Their reasons are that in this time people can get a lot of experience for their future study and work.

On the other hand, there is a different point of view that young people should enter a university after finishing high school without having a gap year.

People who support this opinion are sure that after such a long pause (having a gap year) it will be very complicated to start studying again.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I support the second point of view and my reason is the same - such a long pause as a gap year can interfere young people from study in normal way.

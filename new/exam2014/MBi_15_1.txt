During the period in consideration this number constantly increased and it is supposed to be around 23% by the year 2040.

Similarly in Sweden the percent of population aged 65 and over grew from approximately 7 to more than 25%.

In contrast the number of older people in Japan declined from 5% in 1940 to 3% in 1960 before going through a six-time growth and reaching 27% by the year 2040.

Overall, the graph demonstrates that the length of human life will increase and the number if people older than 65 will have reached approximately 25% by 2040 in the countries in consideration.

Evidentely, the youngest and the oldest groups were more occupied in education in 1998.

The situation with middle aged people was rather stable (except for the technology sphere - there had been a remarkable increase, the same as for all ages).

 Overall, we see that building used to attract more people in 1998, but in 2006 it was the time for technology.

Education and also hotel catering sectors, anyway, didn't see any huge changes.

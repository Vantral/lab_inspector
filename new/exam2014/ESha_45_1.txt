For instance, a half of Yemen's population in 2000 was at the age between 0 and 14 years, but by 2050 this number will decrease rapidly and will be only 37%.

 The changes in Italian demographic situation will be as vibal as Yemen's ones : the majority of its population was about 15 59 years old in 2000, but, according to the forecast, the decline of it will be significant it will be less than a half of all population by 2050.

Some people think it is important to feel youself free from different restrictions, while others claim that it should be controled by the government in some ways.

This essay will discuss both points of view.

First of all, many people say that building any barriers for the expression ideas is against the law.

That is about freedom as a thing government unable to take from any person.

I partly agree with this statement, but still there are some cases, when the freedom of one person restrict the freedom of another and therefore it becomes appropriate for government intervention.

For example, one person write some words on the wall or on something else and it touches the feeling of another person in a bad way, so that it should be done in a way which will not be harmful for other people.

Another point of view lies in the opinion of giving more freedom for artists, who do not want to be frustrated.

There are some resonable arguments also.

For instance, when government ban doing something in a way they wish, artists can not bring their ideas to the society and appeal to actual problems.

Therefore, government have no possibilities to know what is really important for people and what they are concerned about.

To sum up, it seems to me difficult to choose the right course of actions.

I'm sure that it is important to find a balance between actions of government and expression of artist in desirable ways.

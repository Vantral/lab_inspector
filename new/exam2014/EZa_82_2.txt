Let's discuss this problem.

First of all, itis impossible to live without art, that is why te government should not rrestrict artists and other creative people, because they won't be able to express alk their feelings,to make their mind free, and as a result, the society won't receive some works of art.

Secondly, the restrictions should not be made, because of the fact that creative people can't hurt anybody or spoil something.

On the other hand, some of such people can go out of control, especially taking into consideration the fact that some of them use drugs for making their mind clear.

That is why they should not be given freedom in the whole way, some restrictions must be taken to them.

In order to solve this problem, in my opinion, the government should restrict the activity of creative people.

However, the flight of their imagination, their ideas and feelings should not be restricted.

In conclusion it should be said that there are a lot of creative people among us, and if they go out of the control together, it will be a very awful situation, that is why they should be restricted a little.

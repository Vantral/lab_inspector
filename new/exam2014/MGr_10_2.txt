To my mind, happiness is a complex thing consisted of numerous factors that can be differentiated by their materialistic or, in the contrary, spiritual base.

However, it cannot be only materialistic factors, as I have metioned it above, or spiritual ones, they should be matched at the "equillibrium" point that is, one more time, different for all people.

It means that you can reach happiness only with spiritual factors as love and mutual belonginess but; in fact, we know it is not enough or at least, it is not in long-term relationships.

According to some psychological and sociological theories, like Massons pyramide in instance, a person should, firstly, fullfill his or her vital, primal needs in heat, safety and comfort and only after it come about higher ones.

The same does to a person who refuces some spiritual, social values, he can be happy without them only till a certain moment, till he feels he has missed something.

The best way for it is to find an equillibrium between our social, phylosophical (spiritual) and economic need without neglecting any of them.

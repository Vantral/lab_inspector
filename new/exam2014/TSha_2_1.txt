There are some interesting facts concerning the population of people aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden and the USA in the period between 1940 and 2040.

The overall trend in each country is upward, though there is one exception to this which occured in Japan and lasted from 1940 till the beginning of 21st century.

It is obvious that in the beginning of the period the fraction of senior citizens was less then 10%, with the USA having the largest share and Japan - the least.

It is also worth pointing out that the number of this age group fluctuated throughout the whole period and reached a peak at approximately a quarter of the country's population.

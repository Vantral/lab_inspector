The data provided illustrates the amount of people in age of 65 and over from 1940 to 2040 in such countries as Japan, Sweden and USA.

It can be deduced from the graph that the percent of the population aged 65 and over in Japan will increase from 5% in 1940 to nearly 27% by 2040, that demonstrates approximately five times growth.

Similarly, in Sweden the amount of 65 aged population raised from 7% in 1940 to 20% nowadays and it will remain increasing in the project by 2040.

It can be seen from the graph that in USA the proportion of population in age over 65 increased also from near 10% in 1940 and will increase to approximately 25% by 2040 in project, that illustrates 2,5 times upward during the period under discussion.

Overall, it can be said that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over has the tendency to raise from two to fivefold; in Japan the percent will increase five times, while in USA and Sweden approximately 2,5 3 times.

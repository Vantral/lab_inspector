In winter the amount of the demand for electrisity is significantly high at night (almost 40000 units of electricity) then it reaches a low in the early morning (from 7 to 8 a.

On the pie chart it can be seen that the majority of the electricity that is used in English houses is spent on heating -52,5%.

Overall, the graph shows, that typical daily amount of electricity in England in winter is dramatically greater than in summer.

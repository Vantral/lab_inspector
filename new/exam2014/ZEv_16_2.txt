There are probably some common reasons for that and as we can identify them we can succesfully solve them.

 Personally I think that the most usual problem leading to bad student behavior is that students are bored.

It happens, I suppose, because of old-fashioned educational system.

Our everyday lifestyle has changed greatly during the last 30 years but learning systems in many countries do not take it into account.

The way students percept information is new but the way information is given in schools is still old-fashioned.

Thus, students easily get bored and learning process is not succesful.

 There are many ways to solve this problem.

For instance, schools in Norway use modern methods of education, allowing students do what they want and including lots of interactive lessons.

It is often that parents do not pay enough attention to the process of nursing that includes making a child like learning.

For example, some parents are so busy with their work that do not spend time reading books with children or answering their questions about the surrounding world.

This problem may be solved by providing special programms for parents that teach parents the importance of right way of communicating with children so that they love the process of learning.

 Summarising my points I should say that I see two main problems that lead to bad students behaviour in schools : old-fashiond way of teaching and parents' poor attitude to the process pf nursing.

All these problems can be solved by special governmental programes and, of course, by acts of individuals.

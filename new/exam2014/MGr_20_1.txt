Firstly, it is clear that deman for electricity in winter is much more than in summer.

The winter's reach peak at around 45000 units of electricity.

In winter the demand for electricity rapidly increased from 6 :00 to 21 :00.

Secondly, the pie chart shows that the highest proportion of electricity is used for heating rooms and water.

The lowest percentage of electricity is used for vacuum cleaners, food mixers and electric tools.

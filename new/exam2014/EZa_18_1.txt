Finally, lightning, TV and radio consume 15% of electricity what is equel tovacuum cleaners, food mixers and electric tools.

Overall, it seems to be evident that the electricity consuming in winter is considerably higher than in summer, because heating rooms and heating water are more important in winter than in summer.

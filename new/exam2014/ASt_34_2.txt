These characteristics can be connected to the previous ones which we show in the first years of life after our birth but their whole inner content will be another.

On the other hand, some researchers provides us information that the personality of each man depends on those qualities of the character we are born with.

Firstly, they are sure that process of personal development is controlled by those characteristics and they give us our special way of behaviour.

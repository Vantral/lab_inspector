Obviously, the percentage of those who consider studying to be relevant for future work is the highest for youngsters, whereas the number of adults who are more than 49 prefer to do it in terms of interest.

However, we can not notice a big amount of support for the group over 49, according to the second graph.

As far as reasons are concerned, within the age the percentage of people studying for future career decreases, whereas the number of those who do it for interest increases.

We can also notice that the amount of people from 40 to 49 years become students both in terms of interest and career, which percentage is at the rate of 40.

Moreover, speaking about this age group, employer's support is higher in the group of 40 - 49 than in the group of 30 - 39, which difference is not so big.

 I summury, the number of support is bigger for people over 49 while they do it for their interest, whereas the 30 - 39 age group receive not so much support while studying for career purposes.

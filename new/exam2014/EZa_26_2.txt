Nearly all of us think that happiness should be like something material or something that descends to you from somewhere else, while, in my mind, happiness is a regime of our own minds.

In achieving this state of mind we should be mind-disciplined : be positive and open-minded.

To conclude, I should repeat that happiness is not a gift but a result of our self-discipline.

It is cler fro the pie chart that in winter heating rooms and heating water are the most popular trends (52,5%) in the use of electricity/ In summer the demand for electricity hits a high point (20000 units) when the middle of the day begins.

From 12 to 15 hours, likely, ovens, kettles, washing machines demand a great amount of electric energy (17,5%).

15% of the electricity are used for lighting, TV and radio and 15 percent of electric energy are used for vacuum cleaners, foodmixers and others.

It seems evident that typical daily use of electricity almost does not fall at low level bacause all that machines and tools work often.

All in all, we can conclude that in winter season usual every day demand for electric energy is bigger than in summertime.

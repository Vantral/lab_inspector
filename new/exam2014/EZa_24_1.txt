The graph and the pie chart give the information about needs of electricity in England during the winter and summer periods and the purpoces for which it uses in typical English home.

It is clarly seen that the number of usage electricity in winter is much higher than in summer.

A more detailed look at the graph shows that the bottom of usage electricity in both periods was from 6 to 9 o'clock.

However, the levels of usage energy increased in winter to approximately 40000 in 20 o'clock and approximately 50000 in 22 o'clock.

Overall during the whole period the numbers of usage electricity fluctuated, but the levels in winter were much higher and the main purpose was heating rooms and water.

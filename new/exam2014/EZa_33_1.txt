The graph and the pie chart below provide the information about the consumption and use of electricity in usual homes in winter and summer in England.

 The general view on the graph can show us that in winter people demand for more units of electricity, nearly twice than during typical days in summer.

Moreover the most significant amount of electricity people expense at 21 :00 in winter days and 13 :00 and 22 :00 in summer days.

	According to the last pie chart, the highest percentage of electricity use for heating rooms and water.

This explains why people demand for more electricity in winter than in summer.

The lowest percentage of using electricity in an average home have both aspect - lighting, TV, radio and vacuum cleaners, food mixers, electronic tools.

Obviously, people need to greater levels of electricity in the evenings, because in this time people spend more time at home and use lots of different electric tools.

	To conclude, we should say, that the graph and the chart illustrate really useful and interesting data about the situation with electricity in England.

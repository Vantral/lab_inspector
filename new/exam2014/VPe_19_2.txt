The tendency of taking a Â«gap yearÂ» before going to the university has grown in the last years, but mostly in Western countries.

First of all, if you got high marks on the state exam, which provides you with an opportunity to enter the University without any payments, you might lose your scholarship the year after.

And of course, in Russia it is thought to be obligatory to have not only a bachelor, but also a magister degree (unlike in most European countries), so you feel the need to start earlier in order not to become an Â«eternal studentÂ».

If the procedure of the exams could be improved, so scholarship stayed the same every year and the results could be used during two or three years after taking the exams, gap years would become possible to be taken by many people.

Making a conclusion, I consider a year break after finishing school a good idea, but slightly possible in our conditions.

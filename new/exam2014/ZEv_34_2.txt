A variety of different researches had given some results, and now specialists explain the reasons of bad behaviour in next ways (which, I agree with): for example, they say, hooligans are victims of their personal problems - being heartbroken, experiencing the parents' divorce.

Physchologists note that young girls and boys (especially, teenagers) go through such problems with difficulties - they give full or anger, hatred, sorrow and etc.

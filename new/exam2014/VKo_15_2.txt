Some people think that creative artists should be given the ability to express their own opinion in whichever way they wish, so the government must not control this process.

However, another part of society may think that the creative artists shouldn't express their ideas in the way they wish and the government should restrict this.

In my opinion, creative artists should always be given the freedom of expression their own opinion and should not afraid of government restrictions.

First of all, it will be a good example for all people to express their own opinion and the pluralism of opinions and ideas will lead to real democratic state.

In the other hand, the freedom of expression your own ideas has its drowbacks.

Moreover, creative artists can give some wrong ideas to the society, which can have bad impacts (for example, the idea of smoking has bad impacts of population's health).

As I have said before, it will be better if government will give the creative artists the ability to tell about their ideas without any fear of punishment.

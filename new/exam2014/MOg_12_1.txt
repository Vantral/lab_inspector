Despite the fact that Tokyo's underground railway system is younger and smaller than London's one, it is the most crowded metro system : 1927 millions passangers per year.

Compared with other cities' underground railway systems, Washington DC's one stays in the middle : it's route is much bigger than Kyoto's and Los Angele's systems and a number of passangers per year is much less than in London and Paris.

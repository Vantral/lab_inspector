Ofcourse, such factors as health eating, sleeping, good relashionships have influence on our health, but sport does us stronger, we can do more useful things in shorter time.

One more advantage to increase the number of sports facilities is that, when we have more possibilities to doing something, we can choose activity, that is more familiar for us.

In conclusion I want to say, that sport is one of the best way to improve public health, but people not always have possibilities to do an activity, that the want to do.

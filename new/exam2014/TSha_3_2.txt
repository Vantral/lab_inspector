From my point of view there is no need to establish equal number of male and female students in a group.

For example, engeneering seems to be easy for male, especially when they study cars, while women more often need a couple more hours to understand a mechanism.

Scientists say that the more person is fascinated about a subject (for instance, German language), the less time and energy is necessary to remember new information.

Both these examples show that studying a subject which is not interesting and is difficult will not bring better results finally.

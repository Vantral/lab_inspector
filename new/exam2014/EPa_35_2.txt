The current situation in the world with the great number of diseases and unhealthy lifestyle suggests that something should be changed.

First of all, people would get a better access to different fitness clubs and sport centers just because their number would be growing.

They certainly would like to take sport activities more if they have a close rote model living in the neighbourhood, not on the Internet or TV.

However, some people claim that increasing the number of facilities for fitness would not help.

The first argument is that it is still quite expensive to visit a sport center, for example, and not so many people can afford it.

To conclude, I would like to say that, despite all the counter arguments, I strongly believe that developing sport facilities would affect people`s health very much.

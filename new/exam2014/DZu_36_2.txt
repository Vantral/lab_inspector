Research shows us that our life experiences do not have so much influence on construction of our personality as characteristics wich we have already had affer moment of our birth from our parents.

Moreover I want to notice that not only features that we have from our parents had influence on our personality.

Because during the period of socialization this features can be transformed by ourselves if we want.

It is a very good example from my mothers life : when she was a child she was very fat and she did not have abilities to be a communicative and active person.

To sum up I want to say, that it is very hard to notice where influence on our personality of features with wich we are born ends or what influense is greater on our personality.

But furthermore, my opinion is that some problems in our life, different events influence more, because they make us choose features and characteristics wich we want and "delete" features from parents wich we do not want to exist in our personality.

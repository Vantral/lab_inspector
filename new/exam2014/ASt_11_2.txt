Thus, owing to this quotes adjustement there would be a kind of discrimination, when women could easily enter a university and men - could not.

However, those, who deny these obvious facts, spot on the social reasons why the number of male and female accepted have to be equal.

One of the most significant of them is that it is much easier to create a family , when there is an equal amount of male and female students at the one destination.

In my opinion , university is not the only place to meet your boy or girlfriend , hence, I find this argument as not very convincing.

In conclusion , I want to underline , that everyone have a freedom of choice and given an opportunity to enter any university in spite of the sex.

And I think that we should not make any discrimination only due to the fact that the numbers of male and female students on different faculties is different.

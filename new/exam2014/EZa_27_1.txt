The graph presents data showing using electricity in England during winters and summers.

The line graph clearly shows that the number of units of electricity are temporary rising during all season in winter.

But despite of overall increase, the graph also shows a strict fall in amounts of units of electricity from 40000 to 30000 and from much more than 40000 to 35000.

According to bar chart it happense because of people start using more units of electricity.

For example, morethen halfe of electricity in winter is used for heating rooms and water.

In contrast to winter time, second curve is has not big falls.

The second curve is fluctuated around number of 12 15000 units of electricity.

According to bar chart in this period people tend to use vacuum cleaners, washing machines.

It may be concluded from the chart that by any large using units of electricity depends on weather and other thignt liked with specific seasons.

Overall, summarizing all the dats given, it is obvious that underground systems, founded between the second half of the 19th century and the first half of 20th centery, had more significant transport characteristics and until today may provide transport provide successful transportation for larger amounts of people, than much younger subways, founded in the last three decades of the 20th century

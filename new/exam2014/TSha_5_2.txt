In my opinion, universities should not follow the idea of accepting equal numbers of male and female students.

In this way, univeisities can not set equal numbers of male and female students because of formed lraditions there.

However, there are people who think differenlty.

They argue that setting equal numbers of boys and girls in each subject is necessary.

They also suppose that it helps students to got used to the conditions which they get after graduation.

I do not agree with them.

I personally think that historically men and women have different living purposes and they do not have the same needs in graduating.

So that accepting the equal numbers of male and female students is not a successful idea.

To sum up, different people may have their own unique point of view.

But I think that accepting this idea will not not bring efficient benefits to society.

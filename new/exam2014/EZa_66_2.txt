In my opinion, it is right that, government is controling this part of the cultural world, because some of newcomers in art are trying to use inappropriate content for their work such as enormous nudity, unmannered words and phrases or even scenes of violence.

Although, in our technical era art isn't existing like it was century and further ago, today a lot of artists are trying to create art on their own personal computers or laptops using wide variety of drawing tablets or even simple mouses.

And for every talented artist there's two ways : to work according to rules and censure restrictions and if your art is good enough you have chance to become famous or yoiu can go another way and become an anonymous artist and never reach success.

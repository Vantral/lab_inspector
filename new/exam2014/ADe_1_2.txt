 The closer look at the data shows that it was decreasing in all working categories exept technology in age group from 18 to 25.

For example, in age group of 26 to 35 the numbers was dropped from 79607 to 46409.

 To summarise all the information it should be said that the sector of technologies in the UK was grown up from 1998 to 2006 and the sector of building fell down.

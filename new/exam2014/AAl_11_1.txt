From the graph it can be noted that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over increases from 1940 to 2040 years in all countries, which are presented.

These periods are in 1940 1960 years in the USA; in 1980 2020 years inJapan and the period between near 2015 and 2030 in Sweden.

It should be mentioned that diagramm shows great increase of the population aged 65 and over in shord period of time in Japan between 2030 and 2035 years.

The percentage of population develops in equal way in the USA and Sweden from 1940 to 1990 and it consist 9 percent and 7 percent.

To sum up it should be understended from the graph that percentage of the population aged 65 and over grows and there are no pics here.

Generally, two countries are completely different.

 On the first look we can easily see that to the 2050 the amount of "60+ years" group will almost double in both countries.

But in Italy it will be almos a half of whole population, while in Yemen slightly less than 6%.

The quantity of 15 59 years people in Italy will decrease and reach 46,2%, while in Yemen there is an opposite trend : the amount of 15 59 year people increase and to the 2050 will be more than a half of the whole population.

We can also see a similar trend of decreasing in "0 14 years" group in both Yemen and Italy, but the gap in numbers between two countries is significant.

 All in all, despite the nubmerous differencies there are similar tendention in both countries.

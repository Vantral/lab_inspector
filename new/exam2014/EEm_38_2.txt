In my view, universities really have a situation when more males than females want to learn some subjects.

Universities just can not provide this idea among students, where everybody wants to learn something interesting, not equal-numbered.

The key point is that in faculty, there are, for example, 10 girls and 10 boys, educational process goes better as a result of comparison of views.

Scientists also think that this way of studying is good for student's future, because they became more tolerant and peaceful to the other sex compared with social groups where are same sex people, which are more likely to be sexists.

To sum up, I can say that having both the equal and non-equal number of males and females could bring some advantages and drawbags for communication.

Although I bekieve universities should gain an interest to a subject as a key point of studying.

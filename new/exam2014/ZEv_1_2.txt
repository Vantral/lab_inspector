On the one hand, one of the causes of such students` behaviour is considered to be their age period.

So, the time in school is very difficult for pupils, because it is the period of the foundation of their personality.

In addition, it seems to be a good idea to organise some collectives in shooles where teenagers can go and communicate with each other, where they are able to do smt together or to tell smb about their problems.

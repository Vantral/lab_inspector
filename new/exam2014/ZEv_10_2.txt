The best way to solve the problem is to investigate the cause of the problem and then find some ways of the solution.

In my opinion there are two main causes of these problem and they are very complicated.

The first cause is obviously a family, the behaviour of the child depends on a situation in family.

If a person grows up in a good conditions with care and love, the person will behave adequatelly.

Another important thing is the explanation about good and bad things to a child.

And if the person grows up in the conditions of eternal argues, offending words and without wise teachings, the person's behaviour will be too bad.

I grew up at the outskirts of the city, so I studied at school with a lot of children, who had some problems in family.

The second problem is the lack of discipline at school.
<The AT0><second ORD><problem NN1><is VBZ><the AT0><lack NN1><of PRF><discipline NN1><at PRP><school NN1><. SENT>@
Discipline goes from a family, but it can be changed at school.
<Discipline NN1><goes VVZ><from PRP><a AT0><family NN1><, PUN><but CJC><it PNP><can VM0><be VBI><changed VVN><at PRP><school NN1><. SENT>@
Nowadays the problems with discipline are at least everywhere and teachers don't know how to improve the poor situation.

It is really difficult but possible to make discipline better.
<It PNP><is VBZ><really AV0><difficult AJ0><but CJC><possible AJ0><to TO0><make VVI><discipline NN1><better AJC><. SENT>@
The situation in family can't be changed somehow at all, because it goes from father to son with methods and traditions.
<The AT0><situation NN1><in PRP><family NN1><ca VM0><n't XX0><be VBI><changed VVN><somehow AV0><at PRP><all DT0><, PUN><because CJS><it PNP><goes VVZ><from PRP><father NN1><to PRP><son NN1><with PRP><methods NN2><and CJC><traditions NN2><. SENT>@
So if the family is good, it will be good all the time and if it is bad, it will always be bad.

But the situation with lack of discipline can be changed with a lot of ways.

The best one is punishment.
<The AT0><best AJS><one PNI><is VBZ><punishment NN1><. SENT>@
Schools should be able to have a permission to punish their students for bad behaviour and after few punishments a student undoubtely will understand the things he did wrong.

To sum up I want to say that the problem with student behaviour is very important and complicated and some ways to solve this problem must be found as soon as possible.

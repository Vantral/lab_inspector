Firstly, even if goverment are able to build handieds of new sport centres, it will not change people's mind to try some healthy lifestyle, and it could bring only a disastrious money waste.

Secondly, increasing the level of the people sport life can only be achieve by using a complex of different measures like populatization of healthy lifestyle through commercials and press, providing public health exerciseses and make agitation to attract more people into this new kind of life, that will be much better for them.

To conclude, I would like to say, that increasing the number of sport facilities is great option, but it will work only with the tight integration with other methods, because this kind of improvement had been already done before, and because of lack of the enthusiasm and information has failed.

But on the other hand, talking about universities exactly, there are different situations, when total equality in every subject is mingless.

So, I do not think it will be so clever to accept equal numbers of female and male for such subjects.

To make a conclusion, I can say that gender equality is really necessary thing, and human rights is the most important issue in social life.

But when the question of equal number of male and female students for each subject rises, it should be mistreated.

Furthermore, after a gap year one can simply lose his motivation and desire to study which may well result in his not getting a university diploma at all.

However, it cannot be denied that during the gap year a person can get valuable working experience which will make it easier to find a position in the future.

In addition, taking into account the stress which accompanied taking school exams, a year before university may have a beneficial effect on teenagers mental and physical health, allowing them to recharge their energy.

To conclude, although both points of view make sense, personally I think that it is more beneficial for young people to go int higher education right after their school.

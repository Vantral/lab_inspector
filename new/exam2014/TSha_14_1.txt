The graph illustrates the percentage of the population aged 65 and over in the period from 1940 and 2040 in three different counties.

We can see that in 1940 in all these countries there were not many pensioners, but the USA had almost 10% of elder people and it was the 1st place.

Japan, in turn, had only 5% of them.

Analysing Japan's curve we can see that the situation didn't change significantly until 2000, when the percentage began to rise.

So, there is a prediction than in 2030 There will be a sharp increase.

Talking about twoo other countries, the graph shows us that the amount of population aged 65 and over fluctuated a lot but increased gradually during this period.

To sum up, we can see that the graph illustrates a prediction by 2040.

So, in 2025 the population of 65 year and more old people will rise to about 25 percents.

Japan will be the 1st country with abaut 27%, then comes Sweden, while the USA takes the last place from these ones.

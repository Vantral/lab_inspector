The graph shows how demand of electricit is changing during the day in winter and in summer.

Firstly it should be mentioned that the level of electricity consumption in winter is considerably higher than in summer.

It is not surprising that more than half of total amount is used for the heating purposes.

 The demand for electricity in winter peaks between 21 and 24 hours while summer graph is more flat with two small peaks : the first between 12 and 15 and the second at 23 hours.

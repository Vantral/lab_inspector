Obviously, the most electricity is used for heating rooms and heating water (about 50%).

A more detailed look at the graph reveals that people used electricity for ovens, kettles and washing machines - almost 20%.

Clearly, there were similar trends of the demand of electricity In England during summer and winter days.

The demand of electricity in winter is much higher then in summer because of the necessity of heating rooms and heating water in winter.

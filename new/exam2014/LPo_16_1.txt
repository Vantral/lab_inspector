In terms of Sweden, it is noticeable that trend is quite erroting.

It rises slightly from the beginning of the period (approximately 7%) reaching a peak of 25% at the end of the period.

Likewise, quite similar pattern is demonstrated by the USA with just one minor difference.

By contrast, the model for Japan is a bit reversed.

While trends for Sweden and the USA were going up in 1960, the proportion of old people in Japan was on the period of stagnation which continued to almost 1990.

I have had about the research which indicated that the characteristics we are born with have much more influence on our personality and development than any experiences we may have in our life.

There are two different opinions.

Some people think that characteristics given to us when we are just in mother's bully influence out lifes.

I believe that when you are just in a childhood, you behave like father or mother.

In my opinion girls behave like fathers and boys - like mothers.

But if you do not like some characteristics, you are able to change them.

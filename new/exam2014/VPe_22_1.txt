So, the number of students under 26 studying for career is four times as high as the same number but over 49.

And among the number of the students studying for themselves, for interest we can see a steady increase from adolescents to elderly people.

From the second chart we can assume that the biggest quantity of support is given to employees under 26 and the smallest - to those between 30 - 39.

After 26 years there can be observed a slight decrease in the quantity of employer support and after 39 everything is wise - versa.

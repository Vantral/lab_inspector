The giving pie chart and the graph show daily demand for electricity and the ways it is used in a typical English home.

According to the graph, the demand for electricity in winter and summer differs.

For instance, daily demand for units of electricity in a cold season is more that two times bigger between 9 and 21 hours.

As we can see, More than half of total using the electricity is connected with heating water or rooms, but in summer such actions are not very actual, as a result, the total demand decreases.

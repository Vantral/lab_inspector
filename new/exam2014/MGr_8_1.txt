On the first picture it is seen that the majority of the spending of electricity is for winter period.

At the time between approximately 6,30 amd 21 hours it is noticeable the rising to more then 40,000 units and reaching the peak after 21 o'clock.

Simultaneously, the datas show us that the demandings of the electricity for summer period practically does not change for the whole day achieving the highest quantity between 12 and 15 hours and 21 and 24 hours.

Overall, it is obvious that the quantity of the using of electricity depends on the winter period.

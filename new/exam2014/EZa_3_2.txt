You can hardly disagree that it is very important to be happy but when you ask people how it is to be happy and what they need to be happy, you may soon understand that everybody put their own meaning in the word "happy".

In my opinion it's more important to have the possibility than just thinking about what happiness exactly is.

No one can tell you how to be happy besides you.

In conclusion I want to say that if you know what happiness is - it isn't real happiness.

It's your own way - how to be happy and I can't say what factors are important to to be happy because I'm not you and you aren't me.

The graph gives information about the amount of population in the age group of 65 and over in time period between 1940 and 2040 in three countries : Japan, Sweden and USA.

In 1940 the proportion of population in these three countries was almost similar : it was in the frames from 5 to 8 procent.

The lowest proportion is in Japan : it's nearly 8%, but compared with the percentage of population of old people in Japan in 1940, that was 5, the present situation is better.

By 2040 the percentage of population aged 65 and over will reach its peak in all three countries : Japan that had almost all time the lowest items of population on proportion by 2040 can become the country with the population of old people of nearly 27%.

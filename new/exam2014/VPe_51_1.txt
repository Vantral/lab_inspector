This graph shows us how the number (in percentage) of old people (aged 65 and over) was changing from 1940 to 2040 in cases of three countries with very different cultures - Japan, Sweden and USA.

In 1940 Japan had the lowest percentage of old people in the country, Sweden had a few percent : more (about 7%) and in USA it was about 9% of population aged 65 and over.

After that from 1960 to 2030 numbers were slightly in cases of all three countries, but Japan didn't have such high percentage as Sweden and USA in that period.

The difference between them was quite by - in 2020 Japan had the same numbers as Sweden percentage generally grow on 15%.

Although then in 2030 Japan sharply peaked and it was the highest number of population aged 54 and over on this graph at all.

In the end of the graph we can see, that in 2040 Japan had the highest Score and USA was on the last place.

To sum up, in future obviously the percentage of population aged 65 and over will generally grow - as the main trend of this graph.

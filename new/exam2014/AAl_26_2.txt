First of all, there is a necesity to say that one of the advantages of these type of accepting students is the equallity between men and women.

Moreover, there is a plenty of scientist's researchs convincing that working between male and female groups of people in equall proportions gives a much more favor.

Another point of view is that such type of accepting students is useless and pointless.

Supporters claim that such thing can destroy the real competition between students, which is based on knowledge, not on female / male you are or not.

Another drawback of equall accepting numbers is that it can crushed all system of university's academic freedom - government will give concrete numbers of students , who schould study in universities.

And one of the most convincing arguments againts equall proportions between male/female students is that there is no any correlation or connection between knowledge and which sex do you have.

And for the first time, this meosure for accepting equall numbers of students seems like justice, lut it is not real suitable criteria for competition between students.

There is no shame if men are good at law and women in teaching as there is no any discrimination between them in case of disproportion.

Considering all arguments , it can be concluded that the idea of universities accepting equal number of male / female students is not good of all.

Generally speaking, in winter the amount of units, which is used increases between 0 and 3 hours from 35,000 to almost 40,000 with a further descend to 30,000 at 7 o'clock.

Then the amount of units of electricity inreases draimatically and reaches its peak of 48,000 at 23 o'clock.

Overall, the level of usage of electricity in winter is higher because there is a need in heating rooms and heating water.

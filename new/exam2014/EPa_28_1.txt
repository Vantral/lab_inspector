First of all, the number of childrens aged 0 14 years in Italy and Yemen are quite different in 2000 : in Yemen population included roughly 50% of this part, whereas in Italy the part of childrens were only 14%.

Also and the number of other aged groups in 2000 are very various in this two countries, all of them had a difference roughly in 20%.

Mainly, the oldest group of population (people aged 60 and more) is quite big part in Italy in 2000, whereas in Yemen is the smallest group.

Secondly, in projections for 2050, the parts of people aged 15 59 years in Yemen and Italy are almost equal and it leads to 50%.

But other groups - childrens and old people are still differ - in Italy the group of old people are almost a half of population, whereas childrens have only 11%, but in Yemen situation is opposite - in projections population will include only 5,7% of people aged 60 and more years.

So, in general, parts of population in 2000 and in the projections for 2050 are not very differ.

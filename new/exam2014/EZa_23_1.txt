The graph depicts information about electricity usage in England in two seasons (winter and summer) and the pie chart shows for what kind of needs the electricity is used for.

A white segment of the pie chart is the biggest of all 4 segments and it shows that mainly electricity is used for heating.

A more detailed look on the graph reveals that English people use electricity in afternoon more often than in morning hours.

It is 20000 units of electricity in summer when people have no need to switch on the light and 40000 in winter.

In addition the level of spending electricity increases in the evening hours in winter.

The pie chart shows that the highest percentage of electricity usage (52,5) is for heating rooms and water.

To sum up, the typical daily demand of electricity is much higher in summer than in winter.

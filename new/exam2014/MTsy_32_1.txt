The given pie charts show the information about populations of Yemen and Italy, about its age in 2000 and projections for 2050.

First two circles demonstrate the situation about Yemen.

One picture shows that practically half of population is up to 14 years.

Then, 46,3% are 15 59 years old.

People who are older than 60 years are very few.

So we can make a decision that most of people live no longer than 60 years.

expectations showed on the second picture demonstrate some future changes.

The percentage of adults will grow by 57,3% (the difference is 11%) and a number of children will become less in the same measure.

Finally, there are not great chances about old people, they will be still the smallest group.

What about Italy, the charts show that situation is different to Yemen.

First of all, the quantity of people which age is over 60 years is bigger in about 7 times.

At the same time the part of children in Italy is three twenties of all population which is much less than in Yemen.

In 2050 Italy will have close to half of population being old.

Adults and children will have smaller percentage.

Summarising the information, there can be made a suggestion that no matter the demographic situation is in a country, the main tendency in the future is that people will live longer and the number of old people will become bigger.

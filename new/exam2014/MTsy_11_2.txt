People should do sport not from time to time, but regulary and it must become a part of their everyday life.

On the other hand, the increasing just a number of sport facilities can not lead to needed result, because some people do not like sport activities or it can help them to be healthy.

If the people really want to improve public health, they will need a complex measures which will change every part of social life.

For example, people can organize new fasion direction when fast food will be unpopular and because of it people will not eat junk food.

In my opinion, the best way to improve the people health is creating a complex of measures which would have an effect on people.

In addition, I think that just increasing the number of sport facilities can help improve public health only in short run.

It is clearly seen that the largest amount of electricity are spent to heating water or to make rooms warmer.

In winter the units of electricity are firstly rise and then pick the point of 40000 are go down to 30000 between 0 to 9 hours.

In sumer at that time this number is slowly fall and from the number of almost 20000 pick the number to about 12000.

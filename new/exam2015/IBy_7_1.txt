First, as seen from second and third columns, railway expand within cities : the older underground railway has bigger length (excluding one case with Kyoto and Los Angeles).

To sum up, table reveals, that traffic of passengers is related with density of population in the city.

Also in more dense cities underground railway has became earlier.

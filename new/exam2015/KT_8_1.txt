Between 2001 and 2002 the percentage of the Internet access went up by 10% (from 40% to 50% respectively).

The highest level of the proportion of Internet access was in 2004 and it was about 55% in the urban area and about 35% in the rural area.

It is also obvious that the proportion of Internet access in the urban households was much higher than in the rural ones.

For example, in 2003 there were more than 50% of suburban areas with the Internet access and only 25% of the rural households.

Overall, the percentage of the Internet access in all areas of one European country rose dramatically between 1994 and 2004.

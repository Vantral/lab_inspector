Nowadays many businessmen believe that space tourism is a natural extension of today's worldwide tourism industry.

First, space tourism is officially open for business and, what is more interesting, despite that fact that the tickets cost a huge amount of money, some people have already been to cosmos.

There are some companies that have already invested great sums of money and are planning to build special vehicles and even orbital spaces.

In my opinion, space tourism will be in demand, because a lot of things, for example, aircrafts, were firstly created only for certain purposes and were not available for everyone, but later has become an integral part of all human lives.

With the help of space tourism, we can build an infrastructure in space and radically decrease the launch costs and, furthermore, a number of orbital facilities will rapidly be constructed.

Moreover, space tourism can have major consequences for Earth's climate, such as temperature rise at the poles, reducing seasonal ice cover there, because of the huge amount of incompletely burned fuel that will be absorbed by the atmosphere.

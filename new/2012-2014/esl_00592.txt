There are two grahs that give information about the extinction of plant's and animal's species and it's reasons.

The first graph presents the rate of increase of animal's and plant's extinctions in the tropical forests.

 It also shows the futur prospect.

Thus we can see that from 2000 to 2060 the extinction rate will be steeply increasing and the highest number of the extictions will take place in 2060 (50000).

However sinse 2060 the extiction rate will slowly decrease.

The chart gives information about the reasons of plant's threats.

 It shows that the human impact is the most injurious for the plan's life.

The percentage of human impact (81,3) is 4 times more injurious then natural events, that take the second place of disutility.

Besides the harvesting and agriculure are also more injurious then others.

In summury, taking into account both graphs we can say that human needs are very dangerous for the tropical forests, as the humanity consume more and more.

We shoul be careful with the plants and remember that one day they can be completely destroyed.

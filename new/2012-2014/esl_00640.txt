Some people think that students should be selected according to their academic abilities, while others consider schools with advanced pupils and weak ones as a better solution.

 In the first type schools students are devided according to their academic abilies, so weak students are with weak ones and children who prove their better academic abilities are in other scools.

Here I think, there are two ways of how a pupil will perform in such a school.

Among weak students he/she can become the best one and then go to the next level - a better school.

Or the person will think that he/she just cannot reach the higher level, loose the interest and stop studying and then move to the school for children who have problems in studying.

The same can happen to the students with better academic abilities if they decide that they are satisfied with their level as it's higher than students in simple schools usually have.

As to the second type - mix scools - it enables children to feel what support means.

Although, not all the students perform well, they can impove when they see a good example.

However, it can result in failure as well if all students will loose motivation.

To my mind, the success of students depends on how diligent they are and the way teachers conduct lessons.

 To sum up, today different kinds of schools exist to fulfill the needs of children and willings of their parents, so it's difficult to say what is better for all pupils and it's many times easier to choose a good school for your own child/sister/brother.

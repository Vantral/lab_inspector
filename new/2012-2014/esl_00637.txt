It is believed that students in schools should be selected according to their academic abilities, but others don't agree with them, because they concerned that students with different abilities have to study together.

To begin with, i think that the both facts has their advantages and disadvantages.

On the one hand, i'm concerned that if some schools selected their students with a high level of skills, they just want to have spotless reputation as an excellent school.

On the other hand, to my mind, if some school had students with a low level of abilities, that may tell as, that they are some kind of school for children, who are unable to study good, for instance for disabled children.

I am also concerned that it is correct, because it will help to avoid tiffs, because of defectiveness.

Secondly, i want to tell about the fact, that all students, in spite of their skills, should study together.

One the one hand, i think it is good, because it is not right to divide people according their abilities, because it may give a reason for some kind of harassment.

One should note here that if some student see, that all his classmates cope with a studying and he is not, he will be trying not to distinguish from his friends.

In conclusion, i can say that i like both of these facts, and i am concerned that people should decide by them selves if they want to study with people with the same skills level or with people with different levels.

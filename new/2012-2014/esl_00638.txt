It is absolutely different experience, when you study, for example with only humanitarian students or technicians.

But if you don't it's very similar to real life situations when you work in a huge or even not huge company where people of different professions are employed.

On the contrary, students who divided in groups according to academic abilities may be more professional as they don't been distracted by the subjects they don't really required to know.

Also, this type of dividing is useful due to the psychological issues.

People with different interests very often argue with each other and it cause many problems more in childhood making stereotypes about other people for the following life.

Although the second point has its advantages, it is more proper to me to study with students with different academic abilities as it is similar to real life.

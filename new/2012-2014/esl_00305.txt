This paper explores a new approach to lexical typology.

Traditionally, lexical typology has mostly confined itself to a very limited amount of languages and therefore, extensive typological investigation cannot be accomplished.

Unlike the previous projects based on a broad range of linguistic data and involving 30 50 languages, we propose dictionary-based typological investigation on the basis of about a hundred languages.

The research question is whether it is possible to carry out a reliable lexical typological analysis using only dictionary entries.

The validity of our approach is illustrated in detail for the semantic domain of the lexeme 'old'.

The research findings based on the experts' evaluation show that the dictionary-based approach yields a high percentage of reliable data.

The precision is only moderately high, mainly due to ambiguity problems of the examples given in the dictionary entries.

The final stage of our project involves compiling a database of reliable dictionaries that can be used for the further lexical typological studies.

The graph and chart provide information on extinction rate in tropical forests and the types of threats plant life is under.

On the graph we can see, how level of threat to different forms of life in the tropics will change during the twenty first century.

With the lowest number of extinct plants and animals (under 5,000 per million) in 2000, extinction rate will then proceed to a quick and steady growth that will continue for six decades.

Overall, extinction rate will reach incredibly high levels over the years and the main reason to that will be irresponsible behavior of the human kind.

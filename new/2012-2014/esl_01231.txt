I personally think that the employees who are completely satisfied with their lives tend to work better and as a result company makes more money.

First of all, I would like to say that when you are happy it means that you have goals which you want to reach and a lot of them are probably somehow related to money like buying a car or a big house.

So, if you want to reach them it means you really need to work and that leads us to the conclusion that work and happiness always come together.

People spend more time working than doing anything else which means that If someone is happy they love their job and aim to do it well.

However there are some people who do not think that happiness is somehow related to the profit of a company.

They often claim that employees are just a small part of any company and the way they feel is not important at all.

They say success is so much more than that.

They also say that a lot of jobs are related to doing things which do not require a lot of motivation so your happiness is not that important.

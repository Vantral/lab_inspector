The chapter 'Componential analysis' by John Lyons is about an influential theory in the 1950's and 60's.

Despite the simplicity and seeming definiteness of componential analysis, its convenience is still a rather disputable issue.

This critique aims to comment on the weaker sides of this theory, namely : (1) definitions of the names of species; (2) the border between concrete nouns and abstract nouns; (3) indirect meaning and metaphors.

Lyons thinks that the fundamental idea of componential analysis consists in the descriptive words by sets of basic sense components.
<Lyons NP0><thinks VVZ><that CJT><the AT0><fundamental AJ0><idea NN1><of PRF><componential AJ0><analysis NN1><consists VVZ><in PRP><the AT0><descriptive AJ0><words NN2><by PRP><sets NN2><of PRF><basic AJ0><sense NN1><components NN2><. SENT>@
For example, the lexeme 'girl' consists of [+human], [-masculine] and [-adult] and the lexeme 'lion' consists of [+felidae], [+/-masculine] and [+adult].

This set is used for certain aims such as machine translation (e.

However, the analysis deals with the limited range of parts of speech as some verbs and concrete nouns because people are unable to describe in a few words what abstract nouns (e.

The main advantage of this theory is simplicity which could be lost in several cases as some concrete nouns could hardly be defined through sets of basic components.

At first sight, the definitions of the words above are quite appropriate.

Nevertheless, the lexeme 'tomcat' has the same set of sense components as that of 'lion'.

Therefore we have to specify the features or add a new one as different lexemes should be distinguished.

If we describe the appearance or the area of the distribution of lions, the number of components will expand considerably and the item will not be simple and basic anymore.

Thus, in spite of being concrete concepts, definitions of the names of species need further specification to make these sets of components suitable.

In this critique it is proposed to create a special scale of determinability for nouns with 'abstract' and 'concrete' along the edges.

It is suggested that the border between concrete nouns and abstract nouns is not clear.

For instance, the lexeme 'teenager' consists of [+ human] and [+/- male] but how could his or her age be defined through the 'plus-minus' system?

This person is not a child yet but he/she is still not an adult.

Then there are two more components [-adult] and [+child] which exclude each other.

The extra symbol of mildness would simplify the description and prove inconvenience of the basic idea of componential analyses.

Moreover, there would be some variants of the age a person who could be called a 'teenager'.

That is why such lexemes could not be attached to one definite group but they would be treated as a borderline class.

Another problem is that cases such as indirect meaning and metaphors could not be considered.

In the example 'You are not my sister anymore' the word 'sister' consists of [+human], [-male], [+blood kin], [+same mother or father] and something else which means that some of the duties of a real sister are not performed.

It is impossible to attach this abstract meaning to one of the components.

If we do so, the set of components would be not universal anymore and the situation 'Martha, this is my sister,Lora' could not be described.

Therefore componential analysis could not explain semantic interaction in that context.

To sum up, componential analysis is a useful tool for certain aims such as semantic annotation of corpora and machine translation but it has many theoretical flaws which prevent this method from being widely adopted.

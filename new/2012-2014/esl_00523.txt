Since the rise of feminism in the 1960-s women have been trying to equalize their rights with men's ones and it also seemed important for them to reflect it in language.

I understand if the woman is happy when she's accepted for some job which have previously been available only for men, but I can hardly imagine a woman whose life became better when she started to hear "chairperson" instead of "chairman".

Turning to the concrete examples, the "implicative" language which consists of the phrases meaning something different from what is actually said is considered by me as intersexual.

Men and women just apply it to their own life situations which tend to be common for one certain gender than for both of them, but it doesn't mean that I can't say "It will take too long to explain" implying "I have no idea how it works" because of being a woman and not a man.

However, I don't think investigating the differences in men's and women's discourse to be a stupid thing, because what Professor Jennifer Coats was talking about is obviously true.

But there is a slightly different situation with domination in conversations between two genders.

I support the point of view that men often dominate women because of the power they hold rather than because of their gender.

Previously women's role in life itself could not be dominating, and the way they used to speak reflected it.

However, women nowadays are often self-relying, active and powerful enough not to be dominated by men.

To sum up, I'd connect the issue of domination in conversation with person's social position rather than with his or her gender.

There exists another interesting aspect which I think is really connected to the gender, and it is men's and women's abilities to move along the imaginary range of their masculinity or feminity.

It's quite easy for women to speak more and less feminine depending on the situation they are in.

It is harder for them to lower their masculinity, though in some cases it is necessary to be not only "cool" and tough, but, for example, to study diligently and not just to fool around.

Though the argument of Steven Fry and Deborah Cameron is indisputable when they claim language not to be telepathy and therefore any two persons would never understand each other fully, in my opinion, the existence of differences in speech which are connected to gender is also undoubted.

Nowadays, the life of the society is completely different comparing with that in the beginning of 20th century.

One of the changes is the way of buying food, clothes and other goods : today it is not a problem to buy what you want if you have money for that.

That is why for some people (mostly women) shopping became a hobby.

Some people believe this situation to be catostrophical : they are worried about the low level of intelligence which a person needs for this hobby and also about the amount of money which is necessary to spend for it.

As for me, I also do not consider it to be a positive trend : surely, it is better to go to a park or to a museum instead of spending the whole day in shopping centre.

I have to mention the danger of becoming a shop-addict, which could lead to crucial consequences.

But I know some people who enjoy shopping and stay usual students - they do not lose their mind, do not become addicts and do not spend huge sums of money.

If I where them, I would spend time for something more interesting, but I admit that somebody might have other interests than me.

To conclude, I do not consider becoming shopping a hobby to be a positive trend, but I do not think that it is a tragedy.

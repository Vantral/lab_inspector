The graphs show the number of plants and animal extinctions in tropical forests from 2000 to 2100 and the threats posed to plant life.

On the whole, the number of extincted animals and plants is predicted to have increased in more than five times by 2060.

In particular, it is forecasted that starting from 2000 with around 5,000 the number of extinctions will be gradually rising and by 2060 will reach its peak at 50,000.

Afterwards it will have a rapid flow till 2100 having reached slightly less than 30,000 extinctions.

As the chart shows, the most significant threat for the plants with more than 80 percent of all possible threats is posed by humans.

The most enormous number of threats having a human impact are made in agriculture (18,7%) and harvesting (14,4%).

However, natural events are also considered dangerous for the plant life posing approximately 20 percent of all threats with 7 percent made by natural disasters.

Teachers need to incept the idea into their minds : idea that such labour not only gets you work experience, but that a student, by doing such a thing, makes the world, his neighbourhood or his city a better place.

This process, though, should be very careful : by no means should such service be promoted by force.

High schools should be very careful in their methods, because wrong ones can make the student trn his back on charity for the rest of his life.

The line graph and the pie chart give us information about biological and ecological situation in tropical forests : the former presents the number of plant and animal species which are supposed to die out between 2000 and 2100 while the latter shows various threats which can influence the plant life.

The number of plant and animal's extinction will have reached a peak of 50000 extinctions per million species by 2060.

In the period from 2000 to 2050 the figure will see a continuos and steady rise, however, the extinction will sharply increase from 20000 to 50000 in the next 10 years.

By 2100 the number of extinctions will have significantly decreased from 50000 to less 30000 extinctions per million species.

The factor which can considerably influence plant life is human impact constituting 81,3%.

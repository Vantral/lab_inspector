When a few completely different people have to share a flat, very often a number of difficulties emerge.

The matter may become even more complicated if these people don't live in their own apartment but rent it and have to chip in to pay the rent.

So how can people share an accommodation and not feel depressed?

Surely, people who have to live together should work out rules which regulate their activities during being at home and affect the ways of their behaviour.

However, it's no use making these rules too formal!

For example, the ones who share a flat needn't make up a real rota or do something else like that.

I'm sure that just to discuss all features of living together is enough.

Unfortunately, to make up the rules doesn't mean to keep the rules.

Some people are not well-organized enough, others just don't like keeping rules.

As for the ones who are not well-organized, I suppose they could learn how to be more self-disciplined.

As for the ones who always ignore rules, I do believe that a formal rota won't change them.

 After all, the only way to learn to live together peacefully is to improve communication skills.

At the begining, I'd like to say that there is an opinion that there should be schools for students with different abilities that I completely agree with.

On the one hand, students of secondary schools are still kids and it will be better for their maturity to have the possibility to communicate with different people of different mental abilities, aims and character.

Moreover, students that have low grades should have the example of a good student in front of them, just to aim to a high standard of their knowledge.

In additional, if the average grade in class is failing it can be the sign of students' laziness and indifference to the subject and studying itself but not the sign of lack of intelegence and necessity of different educational programme.

On the other hand, there are claims that it is better for students to study together with those who have similar abilities in education.

Students should develop their competitive skills and ambitions that is much more possible in the class of pretty the same level of students.

It can be said that if the standard of students' knowledge is the same teachers can have the same method of teaching for everyone and it is easier for them.

 To my mind, it is a bad idea to differentiate one students from the others.

Children should have the opportunity to grow and develop in more natural conditions than it is suggested in special schools of particular level of knowledge.

	One of the first problems caused by the growing level of the average life expectancy is the issue is the increasing need of consumer products, food and fresh water.

For example, the scientists have proved that the increase of the consumption of a variety of natural sources, such as wood, mineral oil and water must be immediately reduced otherwise it will cause a serious lack of them in future.

Another major problem is the growing of the social budget spent on the support of the aged people in many modern countries, because the longer people live during the pensionable age, the longer they claim the government financial support.

	To conclude, the high level of the life expectancy in the modern world is a significant achievement of the developed countries but not without several side effects.

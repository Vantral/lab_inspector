The issue of whether shopping is a good hobby nowadays or not is certainly contentious one.

Despite the arguments of some people that such activity is an appealing relaxation, it is my personal belief that it is too often just a wasting of time.

Three of principal reasons for this are as follows.

Firstly, although I adore supermarkets, I consider it as a guilty pleasure, because I can't help gazing at rows of canned food and even don't buy anything, forgetting to follow my check-list of food needed.

Secondly, it is obvious that an uncontrollable desire to buy products for the aim of buying anything makes people to buy a huge amount of useless things, which are stocking in the corners of their homes and then I thrown off without standing their owners in good stead.

Yet, perhaps the strongest argument against shopping as a nice hobby is that by following such consuming way of behavior, we unwittingly support the whole consuming society system, whose standards don't resfeet an individual's needs.

In conclusion, I once again restate any view that a shopping obsession is a very dangerous way of spending time.

Not only for consumers themselves, who have a right to choose their hobbies, but also for the whole society, which is dramatically affected by this trend.

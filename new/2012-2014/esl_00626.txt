It is well known that the academic abilities can be very different from one student to another.

That is why the idea of diving people in separate groups, basing on their abilities.

And, as any diving system, that one has its opponents, who believes that ranking people like that is unacceptable.

	On the one hand, ranking people into groups according to their mental abilities is the first step to discrimination and can lead to hazing between groups of different levels.

	Also, then everybody has equal facilities it is good for unity of people and supports the idea of the democracy.

But, anyway, there is a chance that in a group of different levels of mental abilities the level of the most talented part of it will be decreasing because of lack of exercises.

And the less gifted students of the group can lose their motivation, because they will realize the difference of abilities.

	On the other hand, then the group will have about the same level, they will be more united inside the group and will have the same speed of digestion of data, which is good to the studying process, because no one will be bored and unmotivated.

	But there is a chance, that more numerous groups of average talented students will humilate less numerous, but more or less intelligent groups, which can lead to massive discrimination in the society.

	In conclusion, as for me, the diving model of education is more productive and interesting for others, but the levels shouldn't be known for students due to decreasing the chance of discrimination.

That's story of the young man, Alex, and his "droogs", they love to have fun (it means doing the ultra-violence) in night time, like to rob a store, to rape some pretty "ptisas", to have a fight with another gang or to bully some passersby.

The scene of the raping is one of the most naturalistic scenes I've ever read, and it isn't good in that case.

There were two main reasons.

 The former is that that very scene can't be beautiful, because it's based on real accident, it can't be even this horror-beauty type, it must be frightening and disgusting.

The latter is that none of the types of violence can be romanticized.

So, if art shows violence like something elegant, something that can be admires, it makes people think that violence is elegant.

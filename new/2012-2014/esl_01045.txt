In my point of view all of these reviews are enough good, the difference is in purposes set by the authors.

Three of them, which were about Steven Pinkers' book seemed to me a little bit superfluous and flat, but may be if I had read " The sense of style" I would have found these reviews very useful because they include interesting opinions about problems stated in Pinkers' book, and reading them would have complement the experience of reading a book.

 It's enough difficult to read such review without having a summary of book's plot, but it's not that easy to summarize popular science text , so it looks more like a critical article, but not a review.

I found reviews about "Three Men in a Boat" and "To Kill a Mockingbird" more interesting : they are concise and contain a lot of remarkable ideas and thoughts, and as I had read those books after reading reviews I discovered these stories in a new way.

Besides that, I think that if I hadn't read those books I would still like reviews because they give an idea of what about are novels without spoiling plot, so they contain not only assessment of stories but some advice for those who are not sure if they want to read this book or not.

In addition I can say that I liked to read the last 2 texts because of the elegant and beautiful language in which they were written.

To sum up, after reading all the reviews I came to the conclusion that good review should be holistic and structuralized, not too superfluous and not too superficial, giving an objective assessment of the content and easy to read.

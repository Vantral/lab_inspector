The theory of componential analysis used to be a widely known method of analyzing the words in 1950-s, but nowadays this theory practically is of no interest for scientific world.

And also there are some weighty arguments for not-forgetting this structural theoretic framework.

Componential analysis helps to understand all semantic meanings of any word.
<Componential AJ0><analysis NN1><helps VVZ><to TO0><understand VVI><all DT0><semantic AJ0><meanings NN2><of PRF><any DT0><word NN1><. SENT>@
It decomposes the meaning of the words into the sense-components.
<It PNP><decomposes VVZ><the AT0><meaning NN1><of PRF><the AT0><words NN2><into PRP><the AT0><sense-components NN2><. SENT>@
These components are a set of semantic features which helps to represent the meanings of any lexeme.

For instance, John Lyons presents some simple examples of decomposing the words.

"Boy" and "girl" can be split into the sense-components "human", "non-adult" and "male" or "female".

The meaning divides on two groups : one-place predicates and two-place predicates.
<The AT0><meaning NN1><divides VVZ><on PRP><two CRD><groups NN2><: PUN><one-place AJ0><predicates NN2><and CJC><two-place AJ0><predicates NN2><. SENT>@
One-place predicates are filled with the only one place of meaning, for instance, Lyons gives an example of word "John".
<One-place AJ0><predicates NN2><are VBB><filled VVN><with PRP><the AT0><only AJ0><one CRD><place NN1><of PRF><meaning NN1><, PUN><for PRP><instance NN1><, PUN><Lyons NP0><gives VVZ><an AT0><example NN1><of PRF><word NN1><" PUQ><John NP0><" PUQ><. SENT>@
It is a one-place predicate because it corresponds with only the one word "boy".
<It PNP><is VBZ><a AT0><one-place AJ0><predicate NN1><because CJS><it PNP><corresponds VVZ><with PRP><only AV0><the AT0><one CRD><word NN1><" PUQ><boy NN1><" PUQ><. SENT>@
Accordingly, two-place predicates are filled with more than one word, for instance, such words as "father" or "kill".
<Accordingly AV0><, PUN><two-place AJ0><predicates NN2><are VBB><filled VVN><with PRP><more AV0><than CJS><one CRD><word NN1><, PUN><for PRP><instance NN1><, PUN><such DT0><words NN2><as CJS><" PUQ><father NN1><" PUQ><or CJC><" PUQ><kill NN1><" PUQ><. SENT>@
They contains several meanings ("father" = PARENT & MALE).
<They PNP><contains VVZ><several DT0><meanings NN2><( PUL><" PUQ><father NN1><" PUQ><= NN1><PARENT NN1><& NN1><MALE NN1><) PUR><. SENT>@
Also, fatherhood is a two-term relation in which it is possible to add variables : "father" = (x,y) PARENT & (x) MALE (x is a parent of y and x is male).
<Also AV0><, PUN><fatherhood NN1><is VBZ><a AT0><two-term AJ0><relation NN1><in PRP><which DTQ><it PNP><is VBZ><possible AJ0><to TO0><add VVI><variables NN2><: PUN><" PUQ><father NN1><" PUQ><= NN1><( PUL><x ZZ0><, PUN><y ZZ0><) PUR><PARENT NN1><& NN1><( PUL><x ZZ0><) PUR><MALE AJ0><( PUL><x ZZ0><is VBZ><a AT0><parent NN1><of PRF><y ZZ0><and CJC><x ZZ0><is VBZ><male AJ0><) PUR><.

Thus, every sense-component has to contain universal meaning(s) of the words and it is considered to be understandable in every language.
<Thus AV0><, PUN><every AT0><sense-component NN1><has VHZ><to TO0><contain VVI><universal AJ0><meaning NN1><( PUL><s ZZ0><) PUR><of PRF><the AT0><words NN2><and CJC><it PNP><is VBZ><considered VVN><to TO0><be VBI><understandable AJ0><in PRP><every AT0><language NN1><. SENT>@
This theory has several advantages.
<This DT0><theory NN1><has VHZ><several DT0><advantages NN2><. SENT>@
First of all, it is very convenient in defining all meanings of the word in any language (one-place predicates words), for instance, the words "kitten" or "sin".

Secondly, for two-place predicates words componential analysis can describe all "picture" of meanings by showing the roles of agent and patient or correlation of these meanings with a help of formulas.

And finally, the theory of componential analysis also helps to define the antonyms for every word which has it.
<And CJC><finally AV0><, PUN><the AT0><theory NN1><of PRF><componential AJ0><analysis NN1><also AV0><helps VVZ><to TO0><define VVI><the AT0><antonyms NN2><for PRP><every AT0><word NN1><which DTQ><has VHZ><it PNP><. SENT>@
On the other hand, the theory of componential analysis has some flaws.
<On PRP><the AT0><other AJ0><hand NN1><, PUN><the AT0><theory NN1><of PRF><componential AJ0><analysis NN1><has VHZ><some DT0><flaws NN2><. SENT>@
The most significant shortcoming of this theory is its imperfection with the complex-meanings words, for example, "apologize" or "pen".
<The AT0><most AV0><significant AJ0><shortcoming NN1><of PRF><this DT0><theory NN1><is VBZ><its DPS><imperfection NN1><with PRP><the AT0><complex-meanings NN2><words NN2><, PUN><for PRP><example NN1><, PUN><" PUQ><apologize VVB><" PUQ><or CJC><" PUQ><pen NN1><" PUQ><. SENT>@
It is practically impossible to find comprehensible definition or antonyms for such words.
<It PNP><is VBZ><practically AV0><impossible AJ0><to TO0><find VVI><comprehensible AJ0><definition NN1><or CJC><antonyms NN2><for PRP><such DT0><words NN2><. SENT>@
Another problem of the theory is a correlation between natural languages.
<Another DT0><problem NN1><of PRF><the AT0><theory NN1><is VBZ><a AT0><correlation NN1><between PRP><natural AJ0><languages NN2><. SENT>@
The definitions of the words in one language may not correspond with definitions in another language at all.
<The AT0><definitions NN2><of PRF><the AT0><words NN2><in PRP><one CRD><language NN1><may VM0><not XX0><correspond VVI><with PRP><definitions NN2><in PRP><another DT0><language NN1><at PRP><all DT0><. SENT>@
Thus, sense-components are not exactly universal for all natural languages.
<Thus AV0><, PUN><sense-components NN2><are VBB><not XX0><exactly AV0><universal AJ0><for PRP><all DT0><natural AJ0><languages NN2><. SENT>@
In spite of all these disadvantages and shortcomings, the theory of componential analysis was reborn recently.

With developing of computer linguistics this theory began to attract more and more linguists by its simplicity and clear structure.

It effectively helps to create new language corpuses or writing some useful programs which are used to study natural languages.

From my point of view, any linguistic theory which can help in studying natural languages is incredibly important.

The theory of componential analysis might be improved and taken into account more attentively because it could bring a great number of benefits in studying natural languages in the future.

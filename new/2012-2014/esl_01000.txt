Furthermore, online shoppers know little about the quality of goods, that is why buying things online is like a pig in a poke.

Finally, delivery service adds to the total cost of a purchase, consequently, people spend more money.

 To sum up, although online shopping is obviously a simple and convenient way of shopping, buying things via Internet is doubtfully reliable and beneficial.

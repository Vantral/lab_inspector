It is a rather difficult question if schools should select students according to their abililies.

Different people think differently and there are reasons for that.

If students with different abilities study together it provides a stimulus for those who are behind the group to study more and for those who are at the top to hone their skills not to fall down.

On the one hand, if students' abilities are almost the same, it makes it difficult to a particular student to stand out against a background of the others, but such a situation can incite an ambitious student to work hard, to accumulate new knoledges, to ameliorate abilities.

On the other hand, if every student is trying to achieve a success, it may stir up enmity between the students and cause unending struggle, which make the atmosphere become very heated and unsuitable for studies.

From my point of view it is better to study in a mixed group of students because it is easier to understand what you should work on and what you are good at.

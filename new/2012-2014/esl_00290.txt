Coarticulation is a phonetical process of sound alteration, the only discovered and proved purpose of which is making speech more fluent.

The goal of this project is to collect more information regarding the phenomenon.

Since the combination of [Ñ] and [Ñ] in Russian is rare, it's coarticulation is unpredictable.

As this may lead to understanding of reason behind coarticulation establishment, this exact consonant combination has been chosen for the research.

A specific text was composed, then vocalised and recorded for the research purposes.

Oscilogramms of the recorded files were then produced via the Speech Analyzer programm.

These oscilogramms indicated all the processes, that occurred in the speech.

On the basis of what has benn traced on the oscilogramms several assumptions were made (see the course project for details).

These assumptions should lead to further investigation of coarticulation.

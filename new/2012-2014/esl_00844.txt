In the past, shopping was perceived as a routine domestic task.

However, nowadays people tend to go shopping for joy.

To a certain extent, this trend might be considered positive; however, it is a contradictory question, to which extent.

Some people say that shopping is no good at all.

They support their opinion with a certain argument : regular shopping for fun is wasting time and money.

As they say, it is harmful to go and spend money for unnecessary items, while one can buy something much cheaper and more useful.

They also say that person who goes shopping frequently does not purchase items he or she needs at all; they, basically, buy things to go through the purchasing process again and again.

This phenomenon is called "consumerism".

I think that the point, where a real joy from the new purchased item turns into consumerism act is the extent described in the first paragraph.

Below this point all the shopping for joy is a really positive activity : one can buy thing he or she really needs and enjoy both this thing and purchasing process.

Moreover, shopping is not always just a process of looking for a particular item : it's a search for something new that can also be bought and used regularly.

So there is nothing unexpected that the new culture of consuming has appeared and is being developed further and further.

Of course, it has its own disadvantages and dangers; but cultivation of the new culture is a positive trend, which, however, carries its own dangers as well.

So, I think, society has to consume properly, and then there just won't be any negative consequences.

Since the first low-cost airplane flew up in 1949, low-cost carriers have become one of the most popular way of travelling, especially among the people, who travel a lot and do not want to spend huge amounts of money on flights.

Low-cost travelling has clearly very important benefits.

	Firstly, people, who use discount airlines, spend much less money on tickets and, secondly, they still can get quickly from point A to point B.

Or, furthermore, they still can get from point A to point B, because there are such points of destination on the Earth, so you cannot get to them if you do not use an airplane.

For example, the absence of digital communication with ground or automatic brake can lead to the lack of safety.

In addition, some low-cost carriers do not allow passengers to choice seats beforehand, which is why this way of travelling may be not appropriate for families.

In conclusion, although low-cost airlines is chip and quick way of travel, there are some obvious disadvantages for some categories of people.

On balance, I believe, that it is important to have different airlines, so every person could choice the most appropriate for him.

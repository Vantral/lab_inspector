The paper is a corpus study of Russian reflexive verbs encoding dative-marked experiencer subjects, which are considered against the backdrop of their nominative-marked non-reflexive counterparts (such as vspominat'sja 'to come to mind' vs.

The main idea is to examine whether some syntactic features of the predicates have changed diachronically.

The research is based on several hypotheses.

The first one deals with the type of the stimulus (whether the direct object is more estimated than clause).

The second refers to the way experiencer is expressed (reflexive verbs are much more likely to have first-pronoun singular experiencer than non-reflexive verbs).

The task is to compare constructions with discussed predicates that are found in two historical periods (XIX and XXI centuries).

It was aimed to examine the frequency and make a syntactic analysis based on the materials of Russian National corpus.

The main aspect of the analysis is whether the formulated hypotheses were confirmed.

Some hypotheses were not supported by the processed data that is why the implications are various.

Nevertheless, it was discovered that both predicates have different syntactic features and these features appear in a number of certain contexts, for instance, negation.

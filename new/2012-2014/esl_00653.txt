While the Internet may appear the fastest and the most convenient way of meeting new interesting people and contacting old friends, it is always important to remember that most of the information you can find on the net - on Wikipedia, on different forums - is created by half-anonymous persons that take practically no responsibility for their words.

On the one hand, the fact that at least half of all the information on the Internet cannot be considered reliable, makes it a very bad place to look for some arguments for your essays on scientific researches.

People generally believe that the Internet is the best service that helps us communicate with each other, make new friends, share our interests to the world, but we also know that while the Internet makes it so much easier for us to keep in touch with all the world, it also makes it so much easier for maniacs and pedophiles to find and fool their victims and so on.

So, the Internet may e dangerous : the sites you visit may contain lies, the people you talk to may not be who they seem to be, but, in my opinion, it does not make the Internet any lees usefull.

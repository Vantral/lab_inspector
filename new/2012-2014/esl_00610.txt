The graph and the chart in the task reflect statistical information concerning forecast for extinction of plant and animal species in tropical forests and threats to plant life, correspondingly.

According to the graph, the extinctions will reach their peak by 2060, when about 5% of the whole amount of species will disappear.

But afterwards, by the year 2100, the dying out will have slowed down to the indices of the period from 2020 to 2040, in other words, to approximately 10,000 species, or one per cent, in twenty years.

Surprisingly, the lowest figure goes to the first twenty years of the century, when the number of tropical species dying out is presumably only 5 thousands per million species.

This last data displays the fact, that the most part of the human impact on plants can not be eliminated or even reduced as it is directly connected with the food supply and development and the humanity is unable to consume less foodstuff or even slow down its development.

If the prediction made by graph is correct the most probable feature providing the decrease of the extinction of plant species from 2060 to 2080 is the reduction of the invasive plant species (Nowadays they produce five per cents of the amount of danger to plant life).

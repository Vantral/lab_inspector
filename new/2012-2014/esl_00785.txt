Some businessmen today believe that private space tourism is going to become the new step in space exploration and in tourism industry.

Gradually, they became mass means of transport, and today we use them for travelling.

The same transformation is very likely to happen to spaceships too : now it is extremelly expensive to use one for private purpose but in future there might be a way to make it affordable.

As humans have been always looking for the unknown to explore, lots of people will udoubtedly desire to go on a trip to cosmos.

 The only problem in my opinion is safety.

Space travelling is much more dangerous than, for example, travelling by plane.

The design of spaceships is more complicated than that of planes, what's more, there might be unexpected dangers in the outer space, such as comets or asteroids.

So, the possibility of space tourism is a matter of time needed for studying all the dangers that may occur during those trips and for constructing cheaper and safer means of space transport.

I think that if this revolution in tourism happens, astronomy, space engineering and other related sciences and indusrties will start developing by leaps and bounds.

Due to the great amounts of money given by the future travellers, these spheres will be well funded, that's why the space exploration will go on much faster than today.

 On the whole, I believe that the future is full of new astonishing discoveries of the cosmos and that private space tourism will be possible or even popular.

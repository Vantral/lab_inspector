Talking about the distance of students come from, we can clearly see that the number of students which came from within 30 miles of Bristol is significantly decreased over the years from 50 percent to 1 2 percent.

On the contrary, the number of overseas students has been increased from 5 percent in 1928 to 6 percent in 1958 and then it increased very significantly to 28 percent in 2008.

The charts provide information about a long-term survey about wildlife population changes in a particular area from 2000 to present.

The first chart gives main reasons why the different groups of wildlife animals have increased or decreased in numbers, whereas the second one provide these numbers in per cents.

 As we can see on the first chart, there are four main factors for changes in population : habitat destruction, pollution overexploitation and random factors (like accidents and so on), which are in sum have an impact on 91 per cent of changes.

Such factors as disease and introduction of exotic species are insignigicant in this context.

There are only two exceptions : mammals and aquatic mammals, in these groups a number of certain species has increased.

The number of such species as freshwater fish and insects has fallen rapidly, whereas bird and reptile numbers have decreased but at a much lower rate.

Overall, it can be supposed that the changes in wildlife population are not positive, and there is a downward trend for most of animals, so that something has to be done with the factors that causes it.

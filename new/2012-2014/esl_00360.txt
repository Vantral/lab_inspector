Nowadays there are a lot of types of transport : people travel by busses, cars, bicycles, boats and even spaceships.

Of course, in such circumstances it seems that the world has become smaller : it takes a few hours to travel to a differenf city, country or even a continent.

This fact inspires people and makes them think of quicker, more convenient and more powerful mashines.

This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.

Since Russian lexicography lacks of synonymic dictionaries containing information about differences between described synonyms, our collective course project "The Database of Russian Synonyms" aims to create a convenient computer dictionary of synonyms that will provide relevant information about their semantic and collocational differences.

The analysis of each synonymic entry has its common meaning, differences in meanings between synonyms, their common collocations and collocational differences, government pattern and examples.

The correctness of the analyses were tested by native speakers in a sociolinguistic experiment which is also described in the paper.

As for me, I consider shopping more as a routine domestic task.

And it's a conservative attitude because many people nowadays regard it as a hobby.

I don't belay to this group of people but I also don't say that it's a negative trend.

I would say it's even positive I find it great when a person goes shopping and he or she enjoys it.

Very often it turns out that you need some new clothes and you get nervous when you go to the shopping centre and you can't find anything you like.

I guess they don't even have such situations in life that they have to buy something immediately because they probably get new clothes every weekend.

Moreover, they really enjoy it.

But sometimes it seems to me that people are addicted to shopping and it is not good.

It is wonderful when shopping doesn't annoy people but when they make it their hobby it's too much.

This hobby doesn't have any benefits, it is just useless.

I don't think that those who can't live without buying something in a shopping centre at least once a week have so much passion to the supermarkets.

But it's also shopping.

In conclusion, I would like to notice that when a person has nothing against shopping it is positive but when it becomes a hobby it is a bad development.

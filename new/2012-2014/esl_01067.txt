An increasing number of sport programs on television all over the world makes some people believe that teens may be discouraged from doing sports themselves.

To begin with, undoubtedly, television has a great influence on people, especially on the young.

Highly professional matches shown on TV can make adolescents feel that they are not talented enough to take part in such activities.

This happens because they often do not realize that professional sportsmen and - women are ordinary people who have improved their skills through hard training and practice, which is accessible for almost all people.

To my mind, broadcasting of sport programs may lead to the increasing interest in sports due to some reasons.

For instance, such sport event as the Olympic Games may encourage people to be engaged in sports at least as amateurs or just to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

To draw the conclusion, I can say that although TV programs devoted to sport can sometimes be the reason for people's diffidence, broadcasting sports in general stimulates young people to follow their role models' examples in sport.

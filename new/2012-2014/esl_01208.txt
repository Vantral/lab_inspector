There are lots of people out there who have chosen office work over something they really enjoy (for example, history or art) just so they can earn more.

Most of them detest what they are doing, hence poor results, low level of self-confidence, constant feeling of disappointment.

What is more, they sometimes end up with really low salary, because they are not interested in their work and have no ambitions.

I think that even though profession you love does not have a potential to bring you lots of money, your talant, enthusiam and professionalism will help you make a fortune.

But such people are working hard to support their family, so it is possible to understand their point of view.

To conclude, I would like to say that everyone should be able to live their own life and make their own choices.

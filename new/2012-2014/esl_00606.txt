The line graph gives the prediction about extinctions of flora and fauna species for several decades, while the chart shows the specific information about threats to the life of plants.

It is clearly seen on the graph that the extinction of wildlife in tropical forests after a continuous and steep rise will reach the maximum of 50\.

While analysing the chart an enormous (81,3%) impact made by human is seen.

A more detailed look on the pie chart reveals that among different types of human impact more and less than 15% of threats is made by agriculture and harvesting respectively.

Overall, the correlation between the quantity of human impact on plants life and the growing number of dying out of flora and fauna can be seen.

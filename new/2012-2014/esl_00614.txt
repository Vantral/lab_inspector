The graph and chart show the number of extinctions of species in tropical forests from 2000 to 2100 and the ratio of threats to plant life.

It is clear from the graph that extinction of plants and animals will reach a peak in 2060, it will be 50000 species per million, which will become extinct.

After this increase we can see steady fall from 2060 to 2100.

In fact the lowest level of extinction of species was fixed in 2000, it was about 5000 dying out per million species.

A more detailed look at the chart reveals that human impact makes up 81,3 per cent, that makes it the main threat to plant life.

The chart shows us that natural events constitute 18,7 per cent, these figures are equal for only one of human impact, agriculture.

To summarize it up, we can see that the extinction of plant and animal species will reach the highest level in 2060.

Comparing this fact to the chart, we can predict that it may be caused by human impact.

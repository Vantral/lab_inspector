I think I cannot speak about the most valued possession my grandfather has, because he has several things which he prizes very much.

He became interested in stamps about forty years ago.

During this period, his interest became more sophisticated : for instance, now he knows very well which stamp is of great value and which is not.

He told me a story about a stamp issued on the occasion of death of Lenin and showed two types of it : one type is rarer and therefore more valuable (he has both of them).

Moreover, my grandfather draws dozens of new information from his collection.

He reads a lot about the events and the persons pictured on his stamps and finds some mistakes in philatelic journals (sometimes he even writes to the editors).

I am very glad of him that he has such a meaningful possession.

If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologist classes, I would ask them to read a lot of classical and modern literature and to have their own opinion on each book.

It would be great if we could discuss some interesting literary works.

Also, I would tell them not to be afraid of any words and ideas, any metaphors and similes they want to write.

The solution to this problem seems quite simple : we should always tell the truth.

However, what the truth actually is?

And should we be honest in all the situations, despite the circumstances?

Let us consider the possible answers to these questions.

It may seem unobvious at first, but in many situations it is hard to make a distinction between the truth and a lie.

To start with, truth has many facets, such as facts, judgments and feelings.

Unlike facts, judgments and feelings about the problem usually change during our life.

Every variant of them appears to be true, as we feel it is true at the time.

We can consider facts to be the fragments of truth, and everyone makes their conclusions about these facts by their own.

Moreover, there are countless ways of interpreting a single situation.

Most people simply call 'the truth' the way they tend to believe in.

Besides, people's behavior often depends on the circumstances, for example, on the people around and on the place they are at.

Nevertheless, we could not claim all people are untrue and insincere in most situations of their life.

Therefore, the truth can be different.

Sometimes the consequences of telling the truth may be so unpleasant or even terrible, that it is wiser to lie instead.

Apparently, there are a few such cases in politics.

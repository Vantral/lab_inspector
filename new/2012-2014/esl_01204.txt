The chart is describing two different processes.

The first one shows us manufacturing process, the second one describes the process in which the product can be improved in early stages if something went wrong.

Customer demand for goods is certainly dependent on advertisement and discounts.

To sum up, manufacturing process is a huge system and if something on defunct stage of the product goes wrong, for instance, using cheap materials or bad advertising, the product will not be competitive in the market.

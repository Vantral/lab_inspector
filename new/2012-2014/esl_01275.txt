The world economic integration causes international competition that for its turn encourages the production and makes the producers achieve the highest quality of their goods.

As for me the humanity can preserve its cultural and language diversity, we just need to pay enough attention to small and endangered languages, to revitalize them, to help them to spread and develop.

Globalization creates an important basis for solving general problems of the humanity : especially ecological, due to the combining of the efforts of the international community, the consolidation of resources, and the coordination of actions in various fields.

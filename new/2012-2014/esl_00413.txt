Second language acquisition is a considerable problem among linguists which exists since first transactions on the issue were published in the late 60s, early 70s.

In terms of analysis the language there are two ways of studying how does mother tongue influences second language acquisition : using linguistic corpora or making an experiment.

From the points of naturalness and control under the speech, a corpus research becomes a better method to achieve more realistic results.

The general idea of my further course paper lies in a problem of providing more corpus data by making the corpus of mistakes on a material written by native English speakers in a multi-author Russian-speaking blog.

The project serves the purpose of marking - identifying those mistakes and their description from the lexical and morphological points of view.

For that intention were taken such commonly used types of mistakes as calques, which are also significant because of a great influence on the way of constructing and writing phrases on a foreign language.

Modern linguistics is facing a lot of various problems nowadays.

One of the most essential of them is the problem of breaking down the language barriers with the help of computer.

The idea of machinery translation has existed for quite a long time - more than 60 years.

During this period a huge amount of programs and many major projects were made in hope to help people get rid of the problem of understanding each other.

Unfortunately, the quality of this kind of translation is still far from perfect and the dream of translating articles and feature text is remaining a dream.

In my opinion, the problem of translating with the help of the computer is very hard to solve, if ever possible.

The main reason of it is the fact that there are no rules of the "right" translation.

Translating text is not like mathematics where one has just to replace one symbol with another.

In linguistics this way won't work if you want your text to have any sense in the result.

Besides, making up a translation program requires "teaching" it various rules of grammar, phonetics, vocabulary and other aspects of languages.

The problem is that almost every rule has some exceptions so there is no "perfect" language with rules working absolutely the same anywhere (I guess, such a language would be a dream of translating programs and translators in common).
<The AT0><problem NN1><is VBZ><that CJT><almost AV0><every AT0><rule NN1><has VHZ><some DT0><exceptions NN2><so CJS><there EX0><is VBZ><no AT0><" PUQ><perfect AJ0><" PUQ><language NN1><with PRP><rules NN2><working VVG><absolutely AV0><the AT0><same DT0><anywhere AV0><( PUL><I PNP><guess VVB><, PUN><such DT0><a AT0><language NN1><would VM0><be VBI><a AT0><dream NN1><of PRF><translating VVG><programs NN2><and CJC><translators NN2><in PRP><common AJ0><) PUR><.

It means such a program should also be able to find out such exceptions and translate them correctly, and this task is not as easy as it may seem.

Another problem of translation programs is their incapacity of translating some words and phrases correctly.

The reason is that many words have different meaning in different situations and a machine translator is usually not able to mind the context.
<The AT0><reason NN1><is VBZ><that CJT><many DT0><words NN2><have VHB><different AJ0><meaning NN1><in PRP><different AJ0><situations NN2><and CJC><a AT0><machine NN1><translator NN1><is VBZ><usually AV0><not XX0><able AJ0><to TO0><mind VVI><the AT0><context NN1><. SENT>@
Besides, translating programs often can't spot the idioms and translate them just as a set of words.
<Besides AV0><, PUN><translating VVG><programs NN2><often AV0><ca VM0><n't XX0><spot VVI><the AT0><idioms NN2><and CJC><translate VVB><them PNP><just AV0><as CJS><a AT0><set NN1><of PRF><words NN2><. SENT>@
All you need to see how imperfect such programs are is to enter any of them and try to translate some sentence (for example, a proverb) into another language and then back.
<All AV0><you PNP><need VVB><to TO0><see VVI><how AVQ><imperfect AJ0><such DT0><programs NN2><are VBB><is VBZ><to TO0><enter VVI><any DT0><of PRF><them PNP><and CJC><try VVB><to TO0><translate VVI><some DT0><sentence NN1><( PUL><for PRP><example NN1><, PUN><a AT0><proverb NN1><) PUR><into PRP><another DT0><language NN1><and CJC><then AV0><back AVP><.

After a couple of such translations there and back again the result will be rather different from the original and will probably change its meaning completely.

So, machinery translation has pretty much to improve.
<So AV0><, PUN><machinery NN1><translation NN1><has VHZ><pretty AV0><much AV0><to TO0><improve VVI><. SENT>@
And yet I think this kind of translation will never become perfect because ability to translate means ability to think like a man.

So people won't be able to teach computers to translate properly until they teach them to think at least like themselves.

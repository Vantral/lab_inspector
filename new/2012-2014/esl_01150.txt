Summing up the debate by opposition deputy (Makhlina Ekaterina) The motion : "Education system based on curricula and standardized testing leads to establishment of indoctrination of the young, which only prepares them for life of conformity".

As a member of opposition, I strongly believe, that this statement is wrong for the following reasons :
<As CJS><a AT0><member NN1><of PRF><opposition NN1><, PUN><I PNP><strongly AV0><believe VVB><, PUN><that CJT><this DT0><statement NN1><is VBZ><wrong AJ0><for PRP><the AT0><following AJ0><reasons NN2><: PUN>@
Nowadays practically all education systems are based on some standards.

All these standards include curriculum and standardized testing.

From this point of view, we can consider education system as a framework, which in some way limits children.

So, as most people in the modern world value freedom as an inalienable human right, it is easy to take this framework as an absolute evil.

What we want is to make people 'think outside the box' (and our opponents have mentions this idiom several times) considering this problem.

Let us look on the development of the word before the moment human begin to exist.

Because what humanity is trying to do throughout its existence is to organize the world around.

From this point of view, systematization and frameworks do not look as something obviously bad anymore.

Now it is easier to consider the frameworks as something that maintain our freedom.
<Now AV0><it PNP><is VBZ><easier AJC><to TO0><consider VVI><the AT0><frameworks NN2><as CJS><something PNI><that CJT><maintain VVB><our DPS><freedom NN1><. SENT>@
For example, law system, that in fact limits us a lot, in the same time keep us safe and thereby maintain our freedom.

As for education system, we believe that that it does not limit person in his desire to be unique and creative, but gives him knowledge he can based on and shows him a starting point.
<As CJS><for PRP><education NN1><system NN1><, PUN><we PNP><believe VVB><that CJT><that DT0><it PNP><does VDZ><not XX0><limit VVI><person NN1><in PRP><his DPS><desire NN1><to TO0><be VBI><unique AJ0><and CJC><creative AJ0><, PUN><but CJC><gives VVZ><him PNP><knowledge NN1><he PNP><can VM0><based VVN><on AVP><and CJC><shows VVZ><him PNP><a AT0><starting NN1><point NN1><.

Our opponents have made a statement : 'Education system's frameworks limit us, and it is essential to think out of the box'.

In this moment I want to ask them : 'If there is no box, the chances to look out of it are incredibly small, aren't they?

In addition, I want to discuss some disadvantages of modern education systems, which our opponents have mentioned.
<In PRP><addition NN1><, PUN><I PNP><want VVB><to TO0><discuss VVI><some DT0><disadvantages NN2><of PRF><modern AJ0><education NN1><systems NN2><, PUN><which DTQ><our DPS><opponents NN2><have VHB><mentioned VVN><. SENT>@
They have said, that marks and good diploma are more important for students that knowledge itself.

Firstly, I do not think that this is completely true (because there are too many people around me who actually love learning and do not pay a lot of attention to the marks).
<Firstly AV0><, PUN><I PNP><do VDB><not XX0><think VVI><that CJT><this DT0><is VBZ><completely AV0><true AJ0><( PUL><because CJS><there EX0><are VBB><too AV0><many DT0><people NN0><around PRP><me PNP><who PNQ><actually AV0><love VVB><learning NN1><and CJC><do VDB><not XX0><pay VVI><a AT0><lot NN1><of PRF><attention NN1><to PRP><the AT0><marks NN2><) PUR><.

Secondly, this disadvantage emerges not because system is standardized, but because it is not ideal yet and marks do not always show real knowledge.

Our opponents have also mentioned that standards should not be used because people are different and cannot be measured the same way.
<Our DPS><opponents NN2><have VHB><also AV0><mentioned VVN><that CJT><standards NN2><should VM0><not XX0><be VBI><used VVN><because CJS><people NN0><are VBB><different AJ0><and CJC><cannot NN1><be VBI><measured VVN><the AT0><same DT0><way NN1><. SENT>@
However, they also have mentioned, that cooperation is more effective that working on your own.
<However AV0><, PUN><they PNP><also AV0><have VHB><mentioned VVN><, PUN><that DT0><cooperation NN1><is VBZ><more AV0><effective AJ0><that CJT><working VVG><on PRP><your DPS><own DT0><. SENT>@
Of course, we agree with this last statement.
<Of PRF><course NN1><, PUN><we PNP><agree VVB><with PRP><this DT0><last ORD><statement NN1><. SENT>@
Nevertheless, we find it important to understand, that common standards are the basis of cooperation.
<Nevertheless AV0><, PUN><we PNP><find VVB><it PNP><important AJ0><to TO0><understand VVI><, PUN><that DT0><common AJ0><standards NN2><are VBB><the AT0><basis NN1><of PRF><cooperation NN1><. SENT>@
It is simple to understand on the example with measuring the length : the common standard of measure helps us to compare the distance between USA and Brazil with the distance between USA and Canada.
<It PNP><is VBZ><simple AJ0><to TO0><understand VVI><on PRP><the AT0><example NN1><with PRP><measuring VVG><the AT0><length NN1><: PUN><the AT0><common AJ0><standard NN1><of PRF><measure NN1><helps VVZ><us PNP><to TO0><compare VVI><the AT0><distance NN1><between PRP><USA NP0><and CJC><Brazil NP0><with PRP><the AT0><distance NN1><between PRP><USA NP0><and CJC><Canada NP0><.

However, this measurement do not really shows all the information (even if one distance is longer, it could be easier to overcome because of the other factors).

But still, it give us some information that is really useful and can be understandable both in USA, Brazil and Canada, because everyone knows what 4054 kilometers means, as 'kilometer' is worldwide known standard of measurement.

To sum up, I want to emphasize, that our opposition team does not find the current education system ideal and as our opponents do, we consider some disadvantages that could be improved.

However, in opposite to our opponents, we believe, that standards are actually do not limit the person, but make the frameworks that help to develop himself and to step up beyond them when he will be ready.

And as a member of the team, I reckon that we have proved this statement.

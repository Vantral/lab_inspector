From the table we can see, that the rate of customers who where satisfied by politeness of flight attendants slightly increased(from 88% to 92%), politeness of check-in/gate agents within 3 years remained on the average level, as well as previous 2 parameters, a relatively high percentage positively evaluated schedule(first, it was 75%, next year it grew to 79% and remained the same till 2007).

The situation with price of tickets is quite different : first percent was 45% and over the period it increased significantly(to 65%).

And the last one, comfort of seats, which wasn't graded until 2007 haven't received very good recall : only 47% graded it as satisfying.

On the whole, customer satisfaction markedly increased(this datum we get from the chart, it has changed from 65% to 72%).

Summing up, we can say that customer service of air companies became better since 1999, but it still needs to be improved, basing on estimates of passengers.

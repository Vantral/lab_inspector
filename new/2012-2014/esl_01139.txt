We've read five reviews on three books.

Two of them written about "Three men in the boatâ¦" and "To kill the mocking bird" were short and easy to read.

On the contrary three others based on the book written by Steven Pinker were long and too detailed.

I believe that the reason of this distinction is that these reviews were aimed to different things.

It should be stated that, in my case, they haven't reached their destination.

To start with, reviews on "Three men in the boatâ¦" and on "To kill the mocking bird" are appointed to the readers, who have not read the book yet and who are willing to know whether they should do it or not.

That is why they are short, laconic and narrate about authors' fillings experienced while reading these books.

I liked them pretty much, but, unfortunately, I've already read those books, thus, they were not that useful for me.

Unlike first ones, other three reviews are intended for the readers who want to get to know people's opinions about the book they've just read as a substitute or an addition to a real discussion of the book.

Thus, those reviews in detail describe advantages and disadvantages of the book by Steven Pinker.

 But, unfortunately, I haven't read that book, thus, it was a bit boring for me to read them.

Most of our employees are women, in age before 40 and they have children of the age of primary school.
<Most DT0><of PRF><our DPS><employees NN2><are VBB><women NN2><, PUN><in PRP><age NN1><before PRP><40 CRD><and CJC><they PNP><have VHB><children NN2><of PRF><the AT0><age NN1><of PRF><primary AJ0><school NN1><. SENT>@
So the first reason why a lot of employees leave early or come late to work - they go to the doctor with their children.

Also the atmosphere in our company is very friendly and a lot of employees sea eye to eye to each other and spend their free time together with their families.

And of course children connect with each other, if one child is ill another will fill ill for sure.
<And CJC><of PRF><course NN1><children NN2><connect VVB><with PRP><each DT0><other NN1><, PUN><if CJS><one CRD><child NN1><is VBZ><ill AJ0><another DT0><will VM0><fill VVI><ill AJ0><for PRP><sure AJ0><. SENT>@
Another reason it is our building.
<Another DT0><reason NN1><it PNP><is VBZ><our DPS><building NN1><. SENT>@
It is really old; the date of its building is nearly 50 years ago.
<It PNP><is VBZ><really AV0><old AJ0><; PUN><the AT0><date NN1><of PRF><its DPS><building NN1><is VBZ><nearly AV0><50 CRD><years NN2><ago AV0><. SENT>@
We have old windows, and bad central heat.
<We PNP><have VHB><old AJ0><windows NN2><, PUN><and CJC><bad AJ0><central AJ0><heat NN1><. SENT>@
So in cold weather the temperature inside is lower the norm.
<So AV0><in PRP><cold AJ0><weather NN1><the AT0><temperature NN1><inside NN1><is VBZ><lower AV0><the AT0><norm NN1><. SENT>@
At the same time the ventilation is bad too, it is stifling indoors.
<At PRP><the AT0><same DT0><time NN1><the AT0><ventilation NN1><is VBZ><bad AJ0><too AV0><, PUN><it PNP><is VBZ><stifling VVG><indoors AV0><. SENT>@
Our employees have to open windows and the temperature becomes lower, of course it is caused illnesses among employees.
<Our DPS><employees NN2><have VHB><to TO0><open VVI><windows NN2><and CJC><the AT0><temperature NN1><becomes VVZ><lower AJC><, PUN><of PRF><course NN1><it PNP><is VBZ><caused VVN><illnesses NN2><among PRP><employees NN2><. SENT>@
After they infect their children and make longer their days off for medical reasons.
<After CJS><they PNP><infect VVB><their DPS><children NN2><and CJC><make VVB><longer AV0><their DPS><days NN2><off AVP><for PRP><medical AJ0><reasons NN2><. SENT>@
Now we could see a chain of arising illnesses in our company.
<Now AV0><we PNP><could VM0><see VVI><a AT0><chain NN1><of PRF><arising VVG><illnesses NN2><in PRP><our DPS><company NN1><. SENT>@
And here are my suggestions.
<And CJC><here AV0><are VBB><my DPS><suggestions NN2><. SENT>@
At first I recommend to make a repair in our building, to change windows and repair central heat.

After that measures the temperature becomes stable.
<After PRP><that DT0><measures NN2><the AT0><temperature NN1><becomes VVZ><stable AJ0><. SENT>@
And of course to clean the ventilation - to prevent opening windows in cold weather.
<And CJC><of PRF><course NN1><to TO0><clean VVI><the AT0><ventilation NN1><- PUN><to TO0><prevent VVI><opening AJ0><windows NN2><in PRP><cold AJ0><weather NN1><. SENT>@
Also I persuade you to give 30% grant for gym or swimming pool for our employees.

It is very important for their health going in for sport, because most of the time they spend sitting on the chair, without moving.

It could cause a lot of different illnesses connecting with back, legs and others.
<It PNP><could VM0><cause VVI><a AT0><lot NN1><of PRF><different AJ0><illnesses NN2><connecting VVG><with PRP><back NN1><, PUN><legs NN2><and CJC><others NN2><. SENT>@
And of course I suggest you to think about their children health too.
<And CJC><of PRF><course NN1><I PNP><suggest VVB><you PNP><to TO0><think VVI><about PRP><their DPS><children NN2><health NN1><too AV0><. SENT>@
In my opinion it will be interesting for our employees and won't cause lots of losses to make summer camp for the children.
<In PRP><my DPS><opinion NN1><it PNP><will VM0><be VBI><interesting AJ0><for PRP><our DPS><employees NN2><and CJC><wo VM0><n't XX0><cause VVI><lots PNI><of PRF><losses NN2><to TO0><make VVI><summer NN1><camp NN1><for PRP><the AT0><children NN2><. SENT>@
For example in the South countries where we have offices too, on the seaside.

For the half-price for the child.

It brings health to our children and our employees won't spend time for visiting the doctor.

So in conclusion, if we make a repair of our office, the temperature indoors will be comfortable.
<So AV0><in PRP><conclusion NN1><, PUN><if CJS><we PNP><make VVB><a AT0><repair NN1><of PRF><our DPS><office NN1><, PUN><the AT0><temperature NN1><indoors AV0><will VM0><be VBI><comfortable AJ0><. SENT>@
If our employees stop feeling cold, they will be healthy.
<If CJS><our DPS><employees NN2><stop VVB><feeling VVG><cold AJ0><, PUN><they PNP><will VM0><be VBI><healthy AJ0><. SENT>@
If they are healthy, their relatives/children will be healthy too.
<If CJS><they PNP><are VBB><healthy AJ0><, PUN><their DPS><relatives NN2></ PUN><children NN2><will VM0><be VBI><healthy AJ0><too AV0><. SENT>@
If their families are healthy they won't take days off for medical reasons and our company won't take losses by this reason.
<If CJS><their DPS><families NN2><are VBB><healthy AJ0><they PNP><wo VM0><n't XX0><take VVI><days NN2><off AVP><for PRP><medical AJ0><reasons NN2><and CJC><our DPS><company NN1><wo VM0><n't XX0><take VVI><losses NN2><by PRP><this DT0><reason NN1><. SENT>@

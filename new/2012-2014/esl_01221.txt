Most of low-costers are punctual and almost never delay flights.

So all these arguments prove that low-cost flights may be more beneficial than flights provided by large companies.

On the other hand, there is an opinion that low-costers have more cons than pros.

Firstly announcing cheap price they usually turn out to be more expensive because every service should be paid separately, for example heavy luggage, food or choosing particular seat as ticket don't usually have a seat number and most of them are uncomfortable.

In addition, time and place of flight may be very unsuitable, therefore getting to the airport may be not as cheap as flight.

In the end, whole sum may be not very different from price of other airlines companies especially during the off-season.

To sum up, although low cost airlines do not provide highly comfortable services, they still give people opportunity to travel safely.

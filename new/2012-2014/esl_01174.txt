In spite of the fact that the Animal Farm was becoming richer and richer, animals except pigs and dogs, a kind of police on the farm, kept up less and less freedom and even more, they were losing their wealth.

Despite the fictional and even fantastic plot, Orwell's "Animal farm" describes a rather realistic society, where pigs are the upper class, and other animals are the lower one.

At the end of the book some other animals, such as Clover, a horse, start to suspect that something is wrong, but they are too shy and week to agree with it.

Of course, there can be some serious doubts about his opinion, but anyway Orwell succeeded.

The language of the novel is quite simple.

As Orwell had said, this fact should have helped translate it to other languages, especially to Russian.

But the main reason, I think, is the way of narration.

But as for me, what makes the novel really wonderful is its capability of being understood both as a political satire and as a live story, which tells us about people's (or animal's) craft and stupidity.

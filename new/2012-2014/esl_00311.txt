Moreover, there is a variety in expressing emotions in different languages : one language can have different variants for expressing a certain emotion, while other languages could lack for such variety to express the same emotion.

However, despite the fact that linguistics has a long experience in the study of emotions in language, there are relevant problems in the general theory of emotions, their designations and functioning in different languages.

      The main aim of our project is to create a linguistic "map" of emotions in different languages and describe which subtypes emotions (like fear, shame, pity and so on) have in each language.

I'm agreed that the source of gap problem between parents' and their children is in lack of knowledge and goodwill from both parties.

Parents always care about their children (sometimes maybe too much care) and children misunderstand them, they always wanted some freedom and didn't like when parents tried to take them over control.

All of us, of course, know Turgenev's novel "Fathers and children", where problem of gap between generations is well-discussed.

Parents should give more freedom to their children, and children should respect them parents and try to follow their advises-and harmony could be reached.

The only aspect of the flying experience the proportion of customers' satisfaction with which fell is courtesy of check-in/gate agents.

Nevertheless, even that decrease is slightly noticeable as this sector went down only by 1 % from 2000 to 2007.

However, the percentage of passengers satisfied with even this aspect has grown from 1999 to 2000 as well as with all other ones.

The diagramm consists the information about the total number of minutes of telephone calls in the United Kingdom.

Results are split into three columns : local, national and international and mobile calls.

The culls were made in a time period, from 1995 2002, so therefore the chart is diveded into 8 years.

Generally, the amount of local calls, and the last transcends the amount of mobile calls.

The columns of local calls increase to the 1999 but then reach the highest point of 90 billions min, while the lowest point is about 72 billions.

The amount of national and international calls gradually rises from 37 to 61 billions during the whole period.

And mobile calls climb from 3 billions and reach its peak at 45 billions in the end of time period.

So, two types have the same realization with rising through the whole time period, but one (local) decreases after its peak in 1999.

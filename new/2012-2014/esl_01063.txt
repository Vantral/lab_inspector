The given diagram shows the steps of manufacturing of the consumer goods and adjustment through the feedback.

First of all, there are raw materials and manufactured components in the storage.

Then, the production is planned and the information returns to the previous step.

There is also a parallel process : the product research and then the product design are done and used in the production planning, too.

After the planning, the product is assembled, inspected, tested (there some information is dropped back to the designing step), packaged and despatched to the sales step-by-step.

 Feedback from the selling is sent back to the production planning stage as well as to the market researching stage.

The information from market research in its turn has an impact on the packaging, advertising and designing stages.

In summary, the consumer goods manufacturing is really complicated process that relates to, on the one hand, manufacturing process which contains the storage, production planning, product research and design, assembly, inspection, testing, packaging, despatch and finally sales and, on the other hand, the information research which involves following stages : the product planning, sales, market research, advertising, packaging, testing and design.

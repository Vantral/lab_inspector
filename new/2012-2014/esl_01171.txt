We can see, that throughout the history of linguistics there were a few ways of describing the language structure.

There was often a standard grammatical model, created for one particular language, and others grammatical models should have been based on it, even if it is not the best way of describing some language.

For example, many modern traditional views on the structure of well-described languages are based on Latin grammar, and the Russian language is not an exception.

But what could we have as Russian grammar if we have tried to describe it in terms of English grammar?

The grammatical structure of Russian language is rather different from the English one.

In this essay I would like to look at the verb system.
<In PRP><this DT0><essay NN1><I PNP><would VM0><like VVI><to TO0><look VVI><at PRP><the AT0><verb NN1><system NN1><. SENT>@
Traditionally, we differ three tenses and two aspects in Russian.
<Traditionally AV0><, PUN><we PNP><differ VVB><three CRD><tenses NN2><and CJC><two CRD><aspects NN2><in PRP><Russian AJ0><. SENT>@
And Russian aspects can be compared with English perfect, continuous and simple tenses.
<And CJC><Russian AJ0><aspects NN2><can VM0><be VBI><compared VVN><with PRP><English AJ0><perfect AJ0><, PUN><continuous AJ0><and CJC><simple AJ0><tenses NN2><. SENT>@
So, we should tell that there are no aspect in Russian and the verbs which differ from each other only by aspect are just different forms of one verb.
<So AV0><, PUN><we PNP><should VM0><tell VVI><that CJT><there EX0><are VBB><no AT0><aspect NN1><in PRP><Russian AJ0><and CJC><the AT0><verbs NN2><which DTQ><differ VVB><from PRP><each DT0><other NN1><only AV0><by PRP><aspect NN1><are VBB><just AV0><different AJ0><forms NN2><of PRF><one CRD><verb NN1><.

For example, 'Ð´ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð»' Ð¸ 'ÑÐ´ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð»' would be considered as two forms of one verb, the first one would be past continuous and the second one -- past simple.

Here is a question : why do we use exactly this prefix for the regular derivation of the past simple, and not one of others?

I am not sure that I am right, but it seems to be the most common and the most neutral in its meaning.

And what is more, we can form a list of prefixes which are forming non-continuous form with their additional meaning.

But why the form "ÑÐ´ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð»" can't be described as present perfect?

In fact, it could be, but it is more likely to describe Russian past passive forms as present perfect.

These forms gives the idea of a result, significant for present, much better, I think.

Past perfect would be the same as past simple, past perfect continuous would be the same as past continuous.

How could we differ present simple and present continuous ?
<How AVQ><could VM0><we PNP><differ VVI><present AJ0><simple AJ0><and CJC><present AJ0><continuous AJ0><? SENT>@
I don't think there would be any morphological difference in Russian, but we can define constructions with 'ÑÐµÐ¹ÑÐ°Ñ' or 'Ð¿ÑÑÐ¼Ð¾ ÑÐµÐ¹ÑÐ°Ñ' as present continuous, and without these words -- as present simple.

In that case we can not differ perfect tenses from others, but we still can differ continuous and non-continuous tenses.

Analytical constructions like 'Ð±ÑÐ´Ñ Ð´ÐµÐ»Ð°ÑÑ' would be considered as future continuous (or future perfect continuous) and synthetic constructions like 'Ñ ÑÐ´ÐµÐ»Ð°Ñ' would be considered as future simple or future perfect.

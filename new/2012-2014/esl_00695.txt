There are a lot of different thoughts about the ways of improving high school programmes.

One of them is to make unpaid community service a compulsory part of such programmes.

In my opinion, it is a very good idea, and there are several reasons for me to think this way.

First of all, such community service as working for charity aid, improving neighbourhood are very beneficial for young people.

It helps them to become more responsible and take care of the place where they leave.

Everybody knows how important it is to appreciate people and the nature, and it does not matter, is it a whole world or just the surroundings.

However, there is an opinion that such kind of service must be paid because children should not work for nothing.

I do not think it is allmost right.

When people recive money from what they do, they start to think it always must take place.

And there is no difference for them between a real work for money and a community service which brings happiness and is good for the whole society.

I think it is very important to make, for example, a work for a charity unpaid, because it will be more beneficial if it is a person's wish.

As a second example, such community service includes teaching sports to younger children and commnicating with them.

As I see it, this point should be compulsory part of high school programmes in order to unite children of all ages.

So, to sm up, unpaid community service schould be a part of high school programmes, because there are a lot of benefits from it.

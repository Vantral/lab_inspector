In this report I am going to describe a table and a column diagram showing the contentment of air travel customers in 1999, 2000 and 2007.

The diagram presents the percentage of generally satisfied and dissatisfied passengers, whereas the table provides guidance on some specific aspects, such as satisfaction of courtesy of flight attendants and of check-in/gate agents, price of tickets, schedules and comfort of seats.

First of all I need to notice that the overall satisfaction increased.

This is evident from the both illustration, the general one and the detailed.

The most noticeable changes happened in line presents customers' contentment of price of tickets, the portion of content passengers has shown a growth of 20 percent points.

The changes of other indices aren't so perceptible; they vary within the limits of 1 4% in spite of the fact that the total satisfaction is increased quite appreciably : from 65% in 1999 to 72 % in 2007.

It's interesting to notice, that the contentment of comfort of seats, which starts to be explored only in 2007, is much lower than the other indices.

So, these tables show that the general contentment of air travel increased more considerably than the contentment of various aspects of travel.

The bigger rise then the rise of general satisfaction shows only the satisfaction of ticket price, which permits us to suppose, that the low prices abate peoples' demands.

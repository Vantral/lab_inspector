Every language has its own unique world of emotion concepts.

It means that across the languages there is no precise equivalent to any emotion term.

Emotion conceptualization gives us the idea of different and common cultural features.

The main aim of this course project is to create a database that shows how different emotion types (for example, pity, pride, shame, etc.

We have to find a general approach to the description of emotion types and their subtypes (for example, compassion, fright, etc.

It would help us to compare as many languages as possible and compose a linguistic "map" of emotions.

This course paper is dedicated to the description of the emotion concept 'pity' in the French language.

First of all, we have to find the words that represent our emotion term.

Then we will find out main semantic features of these synonyms (for example, depth of feeling, reason for it, etc), and defining similarities and differences we will divide them into groups.

As a result, we will give the description both for the whole concept and all the parts of it.

After this our results for the French language will be compared with the data of the concept 'pity' in the Russian language.
<After PRP><this DT0><our DPS><results NN2><for PRP><the AT0><French AJ0><language NN1><will VM0><be VBI><compared VVN><with PRP><the AT0><data NN0><of PRF><the AT0><concept NN1><' POS><pity NN1><' PUQ><in PRP><the AT0><Russian AJ0><language NN1><. SENT>@
During the study we use The New Explanatory Dictionary of Russian Synonyms; most of the examples are taken from several corpora of the French language and VISL project.

The study indicates that in the French language we have the dominant general word 'pitiÃ©' which can be used in different situations.

Then, we have three more words representing this concept that differ from each other in several semantic features.

To sum up, this course project may help to fulfill the small part of the database of the emotional types across languages.

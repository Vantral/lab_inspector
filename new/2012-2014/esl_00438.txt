Although, if my career won't happen to be successful, it would be difficult to switch to another profession due to lack of knowledge and skills I should have acquired at school.

I would have to meet the above mentioned barrier in my mid-ages (30 40) when most professional tennis players end their career and switch to coaching (mostly due to reason that the only thing they know good is how to play tennis right).

	Sometimes I regret that I didn't follow sport career but after that I look at what I have now and see that I can play tennis for my pleasure, I have good education and skills to choose a job that I would like to have, so I can say that the choice I made proved to be successful.

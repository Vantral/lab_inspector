The aim of the research is to find what semantic and morfolonogical features influence the choice of the suffix -Ð½Ð¸Ðµ.

The data for the study was taken from Russian National Corpora and put into a table which contained following information : all verbs from, all possible nomina actionis derivated from these verbs and how many times each of these lexemes was found in the corpora.

The study suggests that the suffix -Ð½Ð¸Ðµ is used when there are no derivatives with other suffixes.

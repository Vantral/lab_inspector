There are many debates concerning teaching systems in schools, namely, whether schools should select students according to their academic abilities or not.

On the one hand, differentiating schools according to the academic abilities of the students has its benefits.

Therefore, there are fewer factors that could slow down the process.

Moreover, there might be competition between these students, which will encourage them to do their best to show the best results.

This factor will also accelerate the process of studying.

On the other hand, the system described above ignores the diversity of the society.

The second option for schools is to have students with different academic abilities studying together.

Grouping students with various level of knowledge allows them not only learn something from the teacher but also to teach other students.

The effectiveness can be seen from the results, that usually shows group work at schools or universities.

Personally I think that both ways of selection give almost the same result.

However, if I had to choose, I would prefer schools with students having different abilities, because this situation is closer to real life and people have to know how to work with those with different knowledge.

For instance, when people work in big companies, this skill is extremely important.

To summarize, the way schools choose depends on the main aim of education, but studying together with people with different abilities prepares for the real life situation.

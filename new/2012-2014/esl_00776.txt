The development of information technology nowadays influences our lives deeply and lets us do a lot of things which were previously considered to be absurd or impossible.

However, as soon as staying in touch with other people wherever they are or collecting or submitting any data became not tales but the reality of life, working outside the workplace is now also not just a fantasy.

	An obvious benefit of this modern mobility is that while having any troubles with getting to your workplace you are still able to do your job properly (unless it' is a physical or practical job which is not connected to the information but comes to making something with your own hands).

It can be incredibly useful for people who have any physical difficulties or who have to stay home for family or other private reasons; for those who live far from city centres and for whom the road can be difficult or far; finally, it's a perfect dream of all lazy persons.

First, an opportunity to continue working while travelling makes it possible for employers to ask employees to stay in touch during their vacation; but in order to feel good and to improve the quality of their work it is absolutely necessary for a person to relax for some time and not to care about anything.

Second, going to your workplace makes you move more or less at least twice a day, change the circumstances and meet other people, while sitting in the same room all day long can just cause health problems, forgetting such minuses as lack of communication, decreasing the number new contacts which could be useful for you, and sometimes getting through boredom to depression.

This concept was carried into Discworld, where the eponymous dimension is floating on tops of three elephants, who, consequently, are carried by Great A'Tuin the turtle.

Some time later they are joined by Rincewind the wizard, Twoflower the foreigner and Luggage the walking chest.

Rincewind then tells a story of his first meeting with Twoflower : bored by his job as a clerk in Agatean Empire, the foreigner decided to move with his Luggage to Ankh-Morpork in search of adventures and heroes.

The wizard's skills in languages had impressed Twoflower, and Rincewind ended up hired by him as his guide.

Since Ankh-Morpork was not the safest city in the Disc and was full of criminals, escorting a so-called "tourist" with a chest full of gold coins had become quite a task for Rincewind.

Even the main characters are quite uncommon for fantasy works : a greedy, cynical, cowardly, oath-breaking wizard expelled from the Unseen University and sometimes trying to rob his companion; a rich but naive clerk that decided to become a tourist; and a semi-sapient walking chest that is loyal to its owner and homicidal to everything else.

In this episode it is also mentioned that when women talk to each other about some failures they would rather turn it into a joke, whereas man would be telling a story in which he would show himself to the best advantage.

Stephen Fry discusses a lot of very controversial things about language (including language of gays), but I m not really sure that this theme is very cognitive.

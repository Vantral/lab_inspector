This demographic table by Australian Bureau of Statistics shows us the percentage of Australian women who gave birth to a particular number of children â from zero to four or more.

 The research had been held for 25 years and data were collected fourfold : in 1981, later in 1986 and then every following decade â in 1996 and in 2006.

Each time only women aged 40 44 were studied (most likely, because it is an age period when women's fertility starts to reduce).

The percentage of women parenting two children seems to be the most steady one : it had risen by 6,6% in the first half of 1980s and then had been maintaining the same level at 35 38%.

To sum up, we can see obvious tendencies in these data : two children is an option for all times, its rate remain stable, but the mean amount of children levelled down, probably, because of the economical development of Australia and the process of globalization.

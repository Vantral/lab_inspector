This report describes a bar chart that shows the total number of minutes of UK telephone calls from 1995 2002.

Three types of calls are presented on the graph : local, national and international, mobiles.

First I will look at local calls.

UK people spend the majority of phoning time on this type of calls.

The number of minutes increases from 1995 to 1998 and reaches its peak in 1999 with 90 billion mintes.

Then there is a decline and in 2002 UK people spent only 70 billion minutes (approximately) on local calls.

National and international calls are on the second place.

There is a slow increase in the amount of minutes spent on these calls from 37 billion minutes to 61 billion minutes (in 1995 and 2002 respectively).

Finally, I will consider mobile calls.

They were really unpopular in 1995 with approximately 3 billion minutes spent on them.

There is a slow growth in number of minutes from 1995 to 1999.

In 2000 this number begins to inrease dramatically and reaches its peak in 2002 with 45 billion minutes (approximately).

To sum up, I can say that mobile calls are becoming more and more popular.

It seems to me that nowadays people spend much more time on mobiles than on local or national/international calls.

Conservative people may think that this is nonsense, but to me it seems only natural : street dancers were once considered troublemakers too - and now they have popular contests all over the world and dozens of films about them.

However, practically all of us can distinguish good graffiti from bad, and that's the first thing that makes it art - you have to be talented or you have to practice a lot to reach the highest level of your skills, like in any other traditional form of art we know.

But if these colourful and meaningful pieces of art find their place on the dull walls of prefabricated houses, then the artists are only doing good to this local community and the appearance of the block.

In Irkutsk the local government hired those "vandals" to paint the long grey fence in the centre of the town, so people won't have to look at that depressingly boring wall while going to the central square, university or any other significant place located near the bank of Angara.

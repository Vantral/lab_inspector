There is no more need to go to the libraries and spend many time, finding pieces of information among the vast volumes of books, all the problems may be solved in a moment by one and only click.

However, there are many things, like spam or advertisements, which can distract users, but it is only a matter of experience - after some unfortunate attempts people become more advanced and concentrated and they can find anything they want very quickly.

However, what many people don't think about is the fact that communication on-line almost replaced meetings face-to-face.

It is very sad, but, actually, everything is in our arms : the Interner gives us many options to communicate and we are the ones who have to decide how to make the best of it.

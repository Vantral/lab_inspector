As I see it, the age of beginning formal education depends on brain abilities of a child, his level of preparation and his/her will.

 It happens really often when parents want to bring up a genius and start to educate their child from the early childhood.

That is why I strongly believe that formal education should start when a child is seven or eight.

To my mind, we should teach children during a game, but make them go to school with a teacher, discipline and rules at the age of four is too cruel.

To sum up, I would like to say that time of the beginning of child's education is up to parents, but they should think about all pros and cons and remember that it is impossible to bring back childhood.

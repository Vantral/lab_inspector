The charts show information about wildlife in a particular area from 2000 to present.

The first chart gives reasons why wildlife figures have changed in the area, while the second chart looks at the wildlife which has been affected.

Considering the first chart, we may see that habitat destruction is a prevailing reason for changing a wildlife population which takes up a segment almost under a half of the whole chart.

The next significant factor is pollution which causes changes of wildlife population in 21 percent of a hundred.

Other factors, such as overexploration and random accidents also have had an impact - about 1/7 of all cases for each factor.

Disease and introduction of exotic species have had an insignificant impact.

In the second graph we can see that the majority of wildlife species has decreased - the figures for freshwater fish and insects are noticeable with drops of over 30% and 40% respectively.

Bird and reptile numbers have also fallen but at much lower rate - less than 10%.

In spite of the problems listed in the first chart, the percentage of such animals as mammals and aquatic ones has actually increased from 10 to 20 per cent, except for hedgehogs and water voles with negligible drops about 5%.

To sum up, as we can see, the information given in both charts approves the evident fact that the influence from outside on wildlife causes far more damage than brings benefit for the whole wildlife on a particular area.

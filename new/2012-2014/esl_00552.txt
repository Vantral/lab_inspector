People born in English-speaking countries know for a fact that Australia offers a great variety of rare animal species that you can only observe in this country, that's why they're the leading demographic for the zoos.

But, nevertheless, Australians are the second most-visiting group, even though most of them must have seen everything in their own birthplace, why is that?

This may be explained by the fact that we often don't value the things we have, and so Australia-born people can be uninterested in their zoos.

Migrants born in other countries, may only see Australia as a English-speaking continent, which is for them, considering that English is quite a prestigious language at the moment; so that's the reason they don't visit the zoos much, and the reason they visit the libraries so much : they are striving to learn the language.

That's the reason behind such high quantity of movie theater visits by Australians, they've either seen everything there is to see in their own country, or they're not interested in that at all.

I must note that theatres are mostly attended by English migrants, this may be due to low interest in operas and plays in Australia, or due to Sydney Opera House being a tourist attraction.

One of the modern problems of Russian lexicography is the lack of representative dictionaries of Russian synonyms that provide big word coverage and all the relevant information at the same time.

The aim of this project is to create a pilot version of such dictionary, which would contain information on semantic and collocational differences among the words in one synonymic entry.

To help the user to choose the most suitable word from an entry the database provides information not only on the general meaning of an entry, but also on the specific meaning of each word, context usage of each word, government patterns and collocations.

The information on each entry is presented in a format of an electronic table and uploaded to the site of the database.

The current course paper includes six tables with all relevant information on each entry and for three more entries there is only a general description, which is the basis for further development.

The additional theoretical and sociolinguistic information on some of the entries is also presented in this paper.

The project provides a new convenient and informative form of dictionary, which is going to be useful and helpful not only to linguists, but to all learners of Russian language.

Her plans for self-improvement are very moving because she is desperately trying to be a good mother to her children, even though she'd rather stay in bed being in gloom and eating chocolate ice cream or drinking wine.

Some parts are just so funny that you can't stop laughing out loud and other parts are so nice and touching that you only can read with a smile on your face.

I'm endlessly in love with Bridget Jones because she is just that truthful female character with silly acts and self-irony.

I think that there is a little part of Bridget in every girl or woman in the world and that's why these novels are so popular.

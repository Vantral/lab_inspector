Therefore she is not given to great shows of emotion or passion, whereas Marianne, who is only about 17 during the time the story takes place, thrives on drama and expressions of emotion, she dislikes and distrusts anyone who does not wear his heart on his sleeve.

I can't help thinking that for me Elinor is by far the more sympathetic of the sisters Dashwood, actually, Elinor and Marianne have also a younger sister, Margaret, for most of the book, though some people may, I suppose, find her equanimity and perfection a little off-putting.

On the whole there's a lot going on in the plot of Sense and Sensibility and there are several major and minor characters that I haven't mentioned, needless to say that I haven't truly managed to dig very deeply into the plot, however I am convinced that the most exciting of this novel is that there are a number of twists and turns to Elinor's and Marianne's romances and both sisters suffer a fair amount of heartache before each finds her beloved.

The plot, which is intricate without being too convoluted, the characters, several of whom have unexpected depth, and even some of the villains are not entirely without nuance, also one of the pleasures of the book for me is that I didn't know who would end up with who.

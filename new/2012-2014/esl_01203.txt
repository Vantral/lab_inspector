In the field of psycholinguistics, there are thousands of experiments occurring daily that attempt to show how language is connected with our brain, and how people, who communicate in different languages, think.

As far as I know, the English language has a lot of tenses, so every action has a special temporary color.

And, the Indonesian language has fewer tenses than English.

Therefore, the Indonesian respondents did not find the difference between two actions, kicking and already kicked.

Furthermore, the experiment shows that in Indonesian, the subject plays a more important role than the action, while in English, people attach more attention to actions.

   I can not be certain, but one more reason why Indonesian respondents may have chosen the pictures of the same man is due to the fact that Indonesia is a country with very modest means.

   To sum up, such linguistic research helps us in understanding not only that language is closely connected with our brain, but these interesting results lead us to think about many other factors that influence our mind, like culture, traditions, religion, and education.

At first glance it is clear that the most visited place is the cinema and the least visited is the theater.

Here the picture is different with 55% of library visitors compared to 40% and 38% of native English speakers.

In general it is difficult to say what group of respondents is the most active but new migrants born in English-speaking countries are more common visitors to two of the four examined places : the zoo and the theater.

However, interestingly enough, the most non-active group is the last one (the new migrants born in other countries) - it has the smallest figures for all the places except for the library.

Some people say that it depends on the employee`s attitude to the work : they like job or not?

But the others claim that no matter if employees are happy or not.

First of all, if employees is not happy about what they do, they will not do their work with great pleasure.

As a result, the quality of work will be low, thus, company will not be successful.

To say more, people, who are keen on what they are doing, who happy do what they do, will be work extremely harder than people, who are not interested in their career at all.

On the other hand, some people strongly believe, that the success of a company depends on employees` qualifications, on their skills and knowledge to deal with the main problems that appeared in different situations.

Moreover, if you do not like your work, you can do it without any excitement, just do what you do with professional attitude to your work.

To sum up, I go for the point that the success of a company straightly depends on employees` happiness and their attitude to work.

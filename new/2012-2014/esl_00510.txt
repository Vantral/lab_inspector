As it can be seen on the graphs, majority of people from all three groups prefer going to the cinema, 70% of inhabitants, 65% of migrants from England and 50% of those, who came from other countries.

In contrast to this situation, a very small number of people like to visit theatres : there are only 20 per cents of Australians, a little more, 25% of migrants from England and merely 10% of people from other countries spend their free time in theatres.

On the other hand, a situation with zoos and libraries is not so cheerless, 40% of the indigenous population, 50% of English Australians and 35% of other migrants go to zoo for entertainment, while 37 38% of natives, 40% of people from England and 55% of people from other countries prefer libraries.

Based on the information from these graphs, it can be concluded that theatres either are not well-advertised or not adapted for migrants.

My suggestion is that Australian government should pay more attention on popularization of theatres and keep on advertising zoos and libraries, whereas cinemas, for sure, will not lose their customers even without intervention of officials.

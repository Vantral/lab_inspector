Here we see table presenting the number of children ever born to women aged 40 44 years in Australia for each year the information was collected since 1981.

The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth.

It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.

We could easily see that women aged 40 44 years are being likely to have two children since 1981 and this tendency lasts until 2006 with rising percentage.

However keep watching over the table we see that unfortunately level of women who don't have children at all rises too.

Table shows us that amount of women aged 40 44 years had four and more children decreases about twice.

The main thing we got from the table is that percentage of women with three children varies slightly, so we could easily say that despite the times women are likely to have three children.

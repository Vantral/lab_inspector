 The book describes us a powerful story which is told through the eyes of a young boy Bruno who had to leave his lovely house in Berlin, his grandparents and friends because of his father who had received a promotion.

Bruno considered his twelve-year old sister Gretel to be "a hopeless case", his mother didn`t entertain him and his father was always busy and didn`t pay enough attention to him.

Being an adventurous child, Bruno decided to explore the area near the fence (despite the fact that he was forbidden to walk there) and he met there Shmuel who was sitting on the ground on the other side of the fence.

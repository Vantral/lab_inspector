In the modern educational system more and more attention is being made to make sure that students acquire practical skills rather than theoretical knowledge.

I believe that this trend has a beneficial effect on the level of competence of specialists, however we should also consider some drawbacks.

One should understand that there is often a strong distinction between the exercises that students solve during the lessons in the university and real problems that they will meet in their future activity.

Moreover, it is often impossible to teach someone certain aspects of the profession just through lectures and books.

For example, it is rather easy to tell a future scientist what are the main results in the field in which he wants to become a specialist.

However, it is impossible to explain him how to come up with the solutions of difficult problems, set productive experiments or invent new theories.

The ability to do this comes up only through experience.

Thus, the practical lessons which imitate the professional activity help students to acquire this essential experience.

It can be argued that such a system can result in a mess in students' knowledge.

For example, the student will try to do science without knowing its basic concepts.

He would spend too much time on a problem that follows from the one that has been solved a long time ago, although if his knowledge was fundamental it would seem obvious to him.

However, I consider that, anyway, a student doesn't need to know basic theoretical subjects in a very big detail, just the things that will certainly be useful to him in his future activity.

To conclude, the acquisition of practical skills during the educational process helps one to be more competent in his activity and the benefits of this trend outweigh its disadvantages.

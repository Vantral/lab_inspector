Evgenjeva and the one called NOSS (ÐÐÐ¡Ð¡) present the difference between synonyms, but they have few entries with detailed descriptions, while a more useful and convenient dictionary should have many entries with brief and understandable definitions.

'Russian synonyms database' is a project that aims to create a useful source of Russian synonyms, which would help Russian language learners to be able to choose appropriate synonyms.

For each synonym we needed to write information on common meaning, semantic differences, common collocations, differences in collocations, government patterns, examples in a clear short format aimed at unprepared users.

The goal was to show the difference between synonyms in such a clear way, that it would be easy to chose the best one in each linguistic situation.

An important task was to describe the synonym with simple and non-professional words to make the database as useful as possible for everyone.

My personal experience has taught me how to deal with words with prefixes -ne (-Ð½Ðµ) and -bez/s (-Ð±ÐµÐ·/Ñ), like bezvrednyi/nevredhyi, bestalannost'/netalantlivost': those that have -bez/s mean complete absence of the feature, those that have -ne do mot have this shade of meaning.

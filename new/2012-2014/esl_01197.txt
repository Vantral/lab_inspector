When I think about important choices I've made, it's hard for me to tell whether my decisions were based on analytical thinking or on intuition.

For example, let's take my decision to leave Israel and return to Moscow to study linguistics.

It wasn't a decision that I made based upon logical arguments; from the rational point of view, it was better to stay in Israel, because of better career perspectives and higher level of living.

On the other hand, it wasn't purely irrational : there were some strong arguments(e.

The choice I'm facing right now is the choice between theoretical and computational linguistics.

I'm not going to make that choice solely on logic or intuition.

I feel like going to computational linguistics without any particular reason, but I also know that it would be better for me to choose computational linguistics because of some practical reasons.

I don't really trust my intuition, so I hope I'll be able to make this choice based on logic.

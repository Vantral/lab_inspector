First of all, a surface of the rock is been destroying for a while and then rock's fragments and stones are carried to the sea.

Secondly, when there are enough amounts of stones and rock fragments, they are mixed with sea salt and moved to the coast, making up bed, one after another.

To sum up, united actions of different powers of nature and long period of time are a necessary thing in order to create a sedimentary rock.

 To my mind, such way of working has many advantages.

Firstly, it gives people a wonderful opportunity to save their time.

Every day a huge number of people spend some time in public transport or in traffic jams, which is not only waste of time but also often brings negative emotions, while in fact almost everything people have to do in office could be done at home.

Such type of job would perfectly suit people who do not like crouds or just some people near them while working and who need silence to concentrate properly.

Furthermore, working remotely, people can choose a place to live founding not only on how far their workplace is but how pleasant it is to live there.

For example, one can even live in a village, spending time in forest or riding horses instead of wasting time on the way home.

Such possibilities are extremely essential and useful for women or, to be exact, for mothers, which cannot work fully for a period of time as they have to look after their children.

 However, a remote job also has some disadvantages.

From my point of view, the worst thing about it is lack of communication.

If a person works at home, he or she probably does not see any people except his or her family.

Besides that, it is rather hard to work being at home as there is nobody who controls you directly.

 To sum up, remote job has both advantages and disadvantages, so everyone has to choose which way of working would suit him or her and to work he or she consider to be the most comfortable.

	First, looking at the situation from the viewpoint of working at home, it is a worthwhile idea if your current job does not bring you enough money or when you are a busy student that wants to have own pocket money - it could be an additional source of income because usually it is not well-paid enough.

	Second, considering pluses of working while travelling, higher extent of mobility helps not to digress from any significant issues related to work during business trips.

One of drawbacks that can outweight its advantages is that such work is usually not well-paid in comparison with traditional work process.

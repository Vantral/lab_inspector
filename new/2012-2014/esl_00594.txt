The graph shows information about the number in thousands per million of plants and animal species becoming extinct from the year 2000 to 2100.

The chart gives insight in what kind of threats and how much of them are caused by human impact and natural events to plant life.

The correlation between these two graphs is that the more threats we provide to plant life, the more extinctions will follow.

As it can be seen on the graph, the number of extinctions of plant and animal species will be increasing slowly from about 5 thousands in 2000 to 20 thousands in 2040.

However, in the next decade from 2040 to 2060 it will rise quickly and will get it's peak of 50000 extinctions per million.

On the chart it is shown that only 18,7 per cents of threats to plant life are because of natural events, people do by far more harm to plantlife, 81,3 per cents.

The most destructive things for plant life are logging, development, harvesting and agriculture, which in sum do more than 50% of harm.

My guess is that it will only become worse in future, because people will need more resources, more food and the impact is going to be more intense.

All these threats are obviously reasons why plant and animals become extinct, they lose thir natural habitants and they die.

So that, it is not surprising that the number of extinctions will become so enormous in 2060.

Then, I suppose, some kind of natural disaster may happen as a reaction to our destruction of Earth, and that is why the number of extinctions will slow down after the year 2060.

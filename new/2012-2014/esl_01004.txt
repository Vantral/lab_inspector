Is that true that people who speak different languages have different world views?

A contemporary cognitive scientist and psycholinguist says yes.

In order to test this hypothesis she conducted different experiments and one of them was to show 3 pictures to English and Indonesian speakers and to ask them which two of three pictures were similar (the first one - a man about to kick a ball, the second one - one of the same man having just kicked a ball, and the third - a different man who is about to kick a ball).

According to the results, Indonesian speakers tend to choose the first two pictures with the same man.

I suppose that it means that Indonesian verbs don't change depending on tense, and if you want to indicate the past or future tense you only need inserting words that indicate the time (that is really true).

I assume that speakers of Indonesian simply don't bother to mark time when they only need to choose similar photos, and only if they need to tell something in words, for example, to tell a story, then they pay attention to the time progression.

In contrast to the Indonesian language, English language has more than twelve tenses which are used in different situations.

The results of Boroditsky's experiment reveal that English speakers are likely to identify the two pictures that show the ball about to be kicked.

From my point of view, it happens because English speakers tend to emphasise the duration of an action, and for them actions are more important than actors who perform actions.

All in all, according to the results of the experiment we can see that language structure do affect our thoughts and worldview, because people who speak different languages differently perceive and think about the same events.

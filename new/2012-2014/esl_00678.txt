In this report I will describe a bar chart that shows a total amount of the UK telephone calls from 1995 to 2002.

The Y-axis shows minutes of the talks and on the x-axis are indicated the years.

The information is presented on 3 main types of the telephones : local telephones, mobile and national and international telephones.

We can observe a slow increase of the total amount of minutes of local calls from 1995 to 1999.

It reaches its peak in 1999 with 90 billions of minutes spent by talking.

Then there is a slow, but stable decline.

The rate of the mobile phone calls is pretty low in the late 90th, but it leaks rapidly after 1999, and in 2002 the total amount of minutes spent by talking on the mobile phone is 45 billions.

We also can observe a slow growth of the national and international phone calls : from 37 billions of minutes in 1995 to more than 60 billions in 2002.

I think there is a correlation between the grows of popularity of the mobile phones and the decrease of the popularity of the local ones : due to the spread of the mobile phones, that became less expensive and thus more accessible, and people find them more appropriate then local phones.

The grows of the total amount of minutes spent by talking national and international phones could be explaind by the process of globalisation : people travel more than before (wether because of the economic situation or just to have a good rest).

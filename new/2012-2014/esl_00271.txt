In the fourth chapter of his book "Linguistic Semantics : an introduction" John Lyons considers the theory of componential analysis.

The componential analysis decomposes the meanings of the words into sense-components.

As soon as the features are organized as binary oppositions within the considered theory, the sense-component "female" can also be represented as "male" with the negation-operator "~".

It should also be said that the definitions made up by the componential analysis can consist of "one-placed" predicates or can be constructed as formulas with variables.

The reason might have been its perfect easiness in applying to words like "high" and "low", "wide" and "narrow", "deep" and "shallow", "start" and "finish".

As a result, componential analysis succeeds in dealing with antonyms and the words which have at least one antonymous component like Russian words "Ð·Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ¸ÑÑ" and "Ð´Ð¾Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ¸ÑÑ".

But when taking not so elementary ones, the componential analysis fails in making accessible and comprehensive definitions.

Even the simplest words like "chair" or "table" can be taken into account as soon as they cannot be defined comprehensively with the help of the features like "wooden" or "heavy" and nothing more.

The problem possibly occurs in the fact that the sense-components used in the componential analysis cannot be organized syntactically.

For example, for the learners of any foreign language it would be more comfortable to deal with the complex definitions made by the normal sentences than with the ones constructed by the componential analysis.

Another problem is the sense-components can be represented by nothing but the words of natural language.

So the inequalities can occur while dealing with foreign languages (and with the single one as well, as the words of natural language sometimes fail in representing the implied features).

It can easily be proved with having at least one look at the basic word "adult", the meaning of which can differ considerably depending on the country.

In my opinion, the componential analysis should now be reconsidered and upgraded as soon as it can bring the real practical benefit, though it still remains quite insufficient for the fundamental linguistics.

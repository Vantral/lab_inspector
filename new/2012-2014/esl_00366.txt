Two hundred years ago no one could even imagine that it would be possible to travel flying above the earth without any difficulty, but now it's a quite trivial to get on a plane and to fly to another city, country or even continent.

For me, the idea of teleportation sounds quite unreal (but not unreal at all), but flying from one place to another looks quite nice.

As far as I know, some means of individual flying have already been invented - for instance, there're some rocket packs.

But using such engines is considered very dangerous, and neither of them are licensed to be used as a mean of transport.

After all, I also can understand why - most of this stuff is not secure enough and the use of such things may lead to injuries or to death.

As for me, if I had a chance to try a rocket pack now, I would refuse as I wouldn't take such a risk.

As for teleportation, I am sure that nowadays scientists can't invent a way of instant transportation of things and humans without any movement as they haven't succeeded in transportation of large groups of atoms when without any destruction of substance.

So it is necessary to make out a way to provide a safe transportation before working on the idea of teleportation, and now it is too early to predict if teleportation if possible or mot.

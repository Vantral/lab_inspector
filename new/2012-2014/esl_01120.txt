In the present age of modernly developing technologies, the question about the exploration of space is truly a burning issue.

However, some argue that space exploration is not about international companionship,but more about each nation's own pride.

The dark mysterious depths of outer space can hide the answers to the questions which may have something to do with the future of the entire humanity.

In other words, this particular issue must be handled on a scale much larger than a single nation, on the scale of the whole mankind.

If all the countries unite their resources in order to explore space, it may draw the world closer to the futuristic cosmological utopia described so many times by all kinds of science fiction authors.

Like in a novelette by Poul Anderson, one day we may even find another planet inhabited by conscious creatures, who may be just like us, exchange our knowledge and let our progress make a significant leap.

It cannot be denied that in order to live in such kind of utopia in the distant future, the approach to space exploration needs to be completely changed as soon as possible.

I suppose that over the next ten years the governments of the highly developed countries will stop spending money on making war with each other and start developing a common space program.

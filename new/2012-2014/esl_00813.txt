The bar chart shows which groups of wildlife animals have increased or decreased in numbers, while the pie chart illustrates the primary reasons that cause such changes.

At a first glance, it is clear that the main factor influencing the population changes was the habitat destruction.

The pollution, which in its turn is more than a fifth of the whole number, has also played a big role in the changing process.

Overexploitation and random factors, for example, accidents, make up less than a fifth of all main reasons, while diseases and the introduction of exotic species are only 6% and 3 % respectively.

 Thus, salmon and trout decreased in their number by nearly a third each, while the amount of bees and butterflies was reduced by approximately 40 % each.

In addition, such species as birds, reptiles and also hedgehogs, water voles were affected in a small number.

However, some representatives of mammals (namely, bats and foxes) and aquatic mammals (otters) have reacted positively to changes and increased in their number by more than 20 percent and 5 percent respectively.

The enforcement can lead a negative consequences and the child may have a lot of problems during the whole scholar period as he might think the education is like a punishment or a mess.

To finish my thoughts I can say that the early formal education is definitely good for each child of 4 5 years, but it should be applied in an individual order, according to the temperament of each child.

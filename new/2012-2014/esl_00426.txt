This course paper explores quite a relevant subject of actual sociolinguistics such as interaction between dialect and standard language.

In particular, this variation between dialect phenomena and ones of standard language (for example, "Ð¾ÐºÐ°Ð½ÑÐµ" and "Ð°ÐºÐ°Ð½ÑÐµ") is distinctly observed in the speech of a city.

In this course paper we investigate the variation between fricative and explosive sound [g] in the speech of urban population of Tula.

As all previous researches were carried out in a whole region and described a lot of phenomena, in this analysis we aimed to focus on the distribution of one specific phenomenon in a city.

Two objectives which we aspired to achieve were to establish the extent of presence of the fricative sound [g] in the speech of the city (doing percent calculation); and to analyze factors which can influence the speech, such as social class, education, place of birth etc.

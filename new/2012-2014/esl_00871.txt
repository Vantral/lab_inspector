Nowadays, when i hear about some championship or World Cup it seems to me that the only thing that counts is the victory, like all the athletes never had such grandmother, who could teach them not to focus too much on winning.

In my point of view there's no problem in desire to win until it reaches by a fair play.

I'm against all the doping and frauds that sportspersons use to deceive rivals and to win, because i think that it needs to be a level playing field for everyone, otherwise, i see no point in such competitions.

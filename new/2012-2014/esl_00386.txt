Some kinds of transport also produce a lot of carbonic gas which is so dangerous and harmful for the planet and its environment.

That's why we need to reduce using this transport very soon or replace it by creating different innovations which will not depend on fossil fuels as a source of power.

I guess the most perspective way is to develop the idea of Maglev train.

   If we use Maglev train or just Maglev transport, it will really improve standards of our lives.

Firstly, Maglev train does not need the fossil fuels for functioning.

It uses magnetic levitation to suspend the train so that it can move without contact with rails.

It also does not produce any harmful effects.

We can suggest that it is clear ecological way to transport people.

Secondly, the speed of Maglev train can reach more than 400 km/h.

It is a real chance for people to get to their jobs quickly, so it will actually save a lot of time.

Another advantage is that it is train and it can transport many people at once.

The problem is that magnets and magnetic blocks are too big and heavy to suspend a whole train.

   In conclusion, I think that kinds of transport such as Maglev train are transport of our future.

The most popular type of entertainment for native Australians is watching movies, while the theater has the less popularity among them.

Less than 40% of surveyed people born in Australia prefer spending their time in libraries, and we can assume that the reason for that lies in the fact that most of them have their own houses where they can read easily.

Our assumption can also be proved by the fact that reading rooms are very popular among citizens of other countries who had moved recently.

Although only 10% of migrants visit theatre, which can be explained due to their full-time jobs, as I personally consider moving to other countries rather demanding and difficult, especially if the country of your origin has other official language.

 Unfortunately, the decreasing popularity of theatre is a world-spreading trend, and this chart is not an exception, as all three surveyed groups of people do not watch performances on stage very often.

As for me, it's not a surprise that Zoo is mostly attended by English-speaking migrants, because native citizens are often tired of visiting the same place and Australians are not interested in going to their Zoo often.

And the third group, which has been mentioned, may experience some difficulties adapting to the new way of living, and a lot of them simply don't have time to watch how animals live.

It is a common knowledge that space explorations are very expensive, too labour and time-consuming.

Unfortunately, since the time when Yuriy Haharin, a russian cosmonaut, made a first step on the Moon, in the space exploration's world has happened nothing really significant.

On the one hand, without any doubt, a potential space tourist must be rich and ready to spend a lot of money for such trip.

Another demand that is more important is that the tourist has to have an excellent health and should be very smart.

In space a body should withstand heavy duty and in the case of new discovery during the trip the tourist ought to act intelligently.

On the other hand, such travels would be extremely dangerous for the tourists and professional team that would escort them and maybe even for all humanity!

To avoid such disastrous consequences the tourists would have to have a serious training, even then it's not an easy to say whether it could be enough, because cosmonauts are training the whole life.

The chart shows the dynamics of two main phone call types, viz.
<The AT0><chart NN1><shows VVZ><the AT0><dynamics NN0><of PRF><two CRD><main AJ0><phone NN1><call NN1><types NN2><, PUN><viz. AV0>@
fixed-line calls (divided in two groups - international and local) and mobile calls.

The amount of fixed-line local calls (in billions of minutes) starts with 72 in 1995, then gradually rises to reach a peak of 90 in 1999 and returns to where it started, with a value of 72, in the year 2002.

The amount of fixed-line international calls is presented to be twice lower than the previous one, on the mark 37.

However, during the whole period, straight to the year 2002, this value steadilt increas to meet its peak of 61.

As for the mobile calls, their part of the graph is the most interesting.

Starting with a value that is absolutely incomparable with the one for fixed-line calls, it rises dramatically over time, declinig its constant growth between years 2011 and 2002 but still reaching the peak of 45 in 2002.

As can be clearly seen, all three bars tend to approach the middle value, which is approximately 55 billions of minutes per year.

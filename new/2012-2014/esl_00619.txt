The graph and the chart provide information on how many species of plant and animal are extincting every decade and what are the main threats to plant life correspondingly.

The main danger for plants is human activity which influences on them nearly 4 times as much as natural event.

Among human impact the three most threatening things are agriculture, harvesting and development which together compose more than a half of possible threats.

It is confusing because such an obvious dangers of human influence as invasive species or disturbance each compose only about 5 percent of all threats.

The same is applicable to natural events, only 7 percent of plants under threat are so due to natural disasters which is probably does not coincide with the common sense.

According to the graph, in 2000 five thousand per million species were extincting every decade.

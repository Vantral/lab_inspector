If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologist classes, I would advice them to clearly identify the subject on which they will write at the beginning and not to digress to much afterwards.

I would also advise them to express their thoughts as clearly as possible and avoid cliches and difficult terms.

In my point of view following these rules will help to convey the idea.

I would also suggest dilute the text with a beautiful metaphor or some other mean of artistic expression, to make it more interesting to read.

I would also give a few examples of good and bad essays to demonstrate which qualities make an essay good and what techniques were used by famous writers.

In the end I would ask them to write a little essay to take stock of the lesson.

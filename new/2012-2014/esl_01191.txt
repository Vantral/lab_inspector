But most of the reviews didn't really impress me.

I didn't find the review on "To Kill a Mocking Bird" good because it spoils not a plot in common, but really important points of it, like "Atticus demonstrates that Tom isn't villain, but the other character is".

So I already know that Tom will be acquitted, but it seems to me like one of the biggest twists of a plot and now everything is ruined, plot is spoiled and reading won't be so fascinating like it could be before.

So this review is more like a brief summary for those who didn't read the book but need to do it before literature classes : there are all the important facts, there are all the problems, take it and write your test.

The reviews on Steven Pinker's book seemed to me too overfull with a personal opinion.

It's great when review shows negative sides of the book too, but not in such expressive way.

I think that review is more neutral genre, it's not a critique.

But is it a real objective of writing a review, to persuade someone to read or not to read something?

The retelling of the plot is just like it need to be - short, superficial but it awakes interest to this book.

If you want to be a common person and have a common salary as your friend, following the rules and being in framework will work for you, but if you want to achieve something bigger, change our world for a good reason, become a recognizable person, it's better for you to drop out of the current framework system, until it's not good enough to offer "creative rules" or something like that where will be creativity involved.

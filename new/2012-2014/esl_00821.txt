The charts provide information on the main reasons for wildlife population changes from 2000 to the present and on the population figures for affected wild animal species.

For 43 per cent of cases, the main factor that influences changes of the wildlife population is habitat destruction.

About a fifth of processes is caused by pollution, while overexploitation, namely, hunting and fishing, and random factors, such as accidents, cause over 15 per cent of changes respectively.

Among these wild animals, positive tendencies are observed only among the mammals and some aquatic animals, except for the hedgehogs and water voles, with an average 15 per cent increase of species.

For example, calculator, small program which is now built into every notebook and smartphone makes pupils and student fully forget how to do menthal arithmetic.

Once I realised that it is hard for me to sum up twenty four and fifty seven in my mind, I've decided not to use calculator for such easy exercises.

Having said that, I think that the gravest disadvantage of this technological progress is not connected directly with our brain, but with our mind.

All in all, I think that, it is true that we rely too much on modern technology, so when we can do things by ourselves, without using any program or device, it is better to do it this way.

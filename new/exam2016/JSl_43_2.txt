To begin with, if governments will introduce new laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure costs of air company will increase and price of tickets will increase too.

In this case, introduction of laws is unnecessary.

Some people suggest that the reason of reduction air travel is that a lot of air travel is unnecessary.

To my mind, it has certain benefit for people.

Furthermore, on the market the machanizm of supply and demand force the number of air travel to efficient amount without certain laws.

 To sum up, governments should not create prohibitions for air travel because all types of travel are connected and reduction of air travel will cause only increase in price of ticket while air travel is necessary for people.

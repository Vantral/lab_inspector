Nowadays enviromental problems become more and more actual.

One of them is air pollution and it is the cause of another big problem named global warming.

Some people think that one of the main cause of global warming is air travelling and government have to reduce the amount of travelling by planes for business and leisure.

I don't think that government will reduse the amount of leisure travelling because it is a big business which gives a lot of money.

Moreover, if compare planes with cars, the second kind of transport makes more damage for air than first.

Fossil fuels of cars is one of the main cause of air pollution and global warming.

Fuels from fabrics also very harmful for the environment.

To sum up, I guess that firstly the government should pay attention on the process of how fabrics protect the air from the fuels.

Because some of them continue to make a big damage to the air despite the fact that they must use filtres on their tubes.

Secondary, I think that the government should spend more money on researches of how to make transports more ecological.

Now these reseatches are in process, but scientists have presented electric cars which aren't harmful for enviroment.

In my opinion, it isn't a good idea to reduce the amount of air travel because people won't like it.

Also it won't be comfortable for all world because planes are one of the best kind of transport and for example cars make more damage than them.

I think that in the nearest future scientists will show ecological planes and moreover after some years all transport system will not be harmful for the enviroment.

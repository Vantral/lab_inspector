The first reason I would like to mention is that modern life is more expensive now than is used to be in the past.

Another reason for that is that many parents put their success in career over family values.

In comparison, in the past family values for more important in the society, that's why majority of children didn't lack parents' attention.

This behaviour of modern parents cause various problems.

First and foremost, children does not feel that their parents love them and care about them, so it can make them feel lonely.

Sometimes they have no one to talk over their problems, they don't feel like they confide their family, so they may get in bad companies.

Furthermore, all parents have to look after their children, as children are unwise but some of them do not show interest in children's life.

If this happens and their parents don't learn about that, in time, it can lead to terrible problems like death of a child.

In conclusion I would like to say that parents shouldn't forget about their children and devote at least several hours per day to them.

Nowadays, the most common way of punishment in human society is prisoning.

While some people argue that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences.

I think, that prisoning itself is not a good way of punishment for the majority of criminlas.

First of all, in prisons people study to do the worse crime because of the environment of punishment and criminal.

As a small, a lot of ex-prisoners commit a crime again.

However, many prisoners did not do some dangerous crime like murdering, so they are not a heard for society nd should not be kept behind the bars.

Also, some of them are just ill people and rehabilitation courses will help them more than imprisonment.

On the other hand, for dangerous criminals it would be nice to give them longer sentence, but in this way government should pay attention to the problem of finding work for ex-prisoners.

It is very widespread problem that should be solved in order to prevent some new crime from this people.

Actually, I think that some fees and social works will be better for the vast majority of people that now are in prisons.

It will save lots of money for government and make judgment system more loyal to people.

To conclude I want to say that society will be better if imprisonment would not be the most common and the main way of punishment.

In addition, I think that loyal atmosphere to people in prison like it is in Norway will reduce some repeat of crime and people would try to improve themselves instead of being the worst criminals.

Maybe in the future fees and social works will replace prisoning and, personally, I think it will be better for criminals and society.

To my opinion, such steps to reducing the number of air transportation are pointless because they limit people's possibility to move around the world and can make several problems for our globalisafied society.

I think that there is no necessarity to create strict laws and to reduce air travel rate but we should also think of our planet harmed and damaged by our actions because it is home for future generations.

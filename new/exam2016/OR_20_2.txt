Goverment may use a lot of abilities to improve the enviroment of our planet, so working with air travels may help to solve a small part of ecology problems.

More than that such aspect as air travel are not the most important one because nowadays there are a lot of different things wich stimulate the pollution all over the world.

In this way goverment will not deal with such problems as air pollution, because there are a lot of ecological problems, wich humans have.

To my mind, first of all people living on air planet should take care about all aspects of ecology sistem, not only air pollution and global warming.

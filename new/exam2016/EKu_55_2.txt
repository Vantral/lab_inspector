Rising amount of crime during the last 15 years has become a serious reason for the government to start thinking about restricting prison sentences.

Some people support the idea of making sentences longer; however, the others believe that there are alternative ways to make the punishment strict.

On the one hand, by giving longer prison sentences, people, who have once thought of reducing a crime, will get frightened when seeing the conditions they may appear in if being caught by policemen.

 On the other hand, the government and security can try to eliminate the increasing number of theft and other crimes like vandalism by making people doing social works.

Overall, the offer to provide with alternative ways can be taken, but I do not think that it can be better.

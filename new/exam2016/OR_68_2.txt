There is an opinion that this kind of transport make involve significantly to air pollution and global warming, so these people suggest to create legislation for decreasing the number of air travels.

It is true that the level of air pollution is extremely high that ace is malt and that governments all over the world and international organisations like WWF try to solve such a big problem.

However, I am not sure that air traveling might cause this problem itself : increasing number of manufactures, fabrics and companies which have a "dirty" working process have the influence on air no more than planes.

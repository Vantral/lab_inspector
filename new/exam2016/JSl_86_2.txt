Moreover, opening new offices of companies in developing countries can make influence on the level of education because most children in poorer countries take not a good education so this development can give them to study for working on factories and take a better education.

All in all, I truly believe that the advantages of opening international businesses on developing countries outweigh the disadvantages because if national companies provide high - quality products there will be no problem with national business.

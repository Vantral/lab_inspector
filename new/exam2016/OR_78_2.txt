As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, our government should create some ways to reduce a number of such travels by introducing special laws.

For instance, getting higher taxes for flights will make ticket prices more expensive and some of travelers will prefer plans to other types of transport, such as trains or busses.

On the other hand, the biggest part of nowaday's transport produce as much CO2 as the plans, which makes such measures of struggling with air pollution as reducing number of air flights, not so efficient.

If people would prefer to travel by busses, it will cause increasing number of bus travels, which could produce much more CO2 then even plans in the recent future.

Summarizing all the fact said before, I should agree that nowaday's transport and pollution it provides are the greatest problems of modern world, and it is worth struggling with them.

Doubtless, that air travel is one of the factors of global warming, but not the major one, and if we want to win this fight, we should get a great complex of measures to create a type of a transport, which doesn't pollute our atmosphere.

In our world a lot of people prefer to travel by airplanes.

But some people think that it is wrong, because air travel is dangerous for our environment.

Territories of forests which can clean air and make oxygen is very small because of deforestation.

Air planes produce some hard gases in the atmosphere, which can set on trees and pollute environment.

Air travel is not the best way to travel.

But we can find a lot of ways to reduse results of this problem.

Reduce the amount of air travel can be hot useful, and this is too hard way in my point of view and point of view of a lot of people.

Reduction of air transport will nave a bad results if people will begin travel on trains and busses.

These types of transport are more dangerous for environment and allows to develop green-house effect.

Moreover, air transport is the most harmless type of transport.

In addition, reduction of air transport will have negative results for air companies and this business in sum.

I consider that instead of reduction air travel people should to grow new forests and control chemical and feed production on factories.

To sum up, I would to say that thi problem two sides, but I still believe that people can pay attention on other ways to solve problem of pollution, and on other ways to support our environment.

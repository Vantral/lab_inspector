There are a great number of debates wheather air travels pollute nature and contribute global warming or not.

Of course, it reduce time for travel but, may be, planes are cause of much consequanses for environment.

I somewat agree with the statement, that government must commite different limits on air travel in order to prevent global warming.

First of all, there are many things to be said in favour of introducing laws to reduce the amount of air travels.

It can not be denied that planes like cars pollute flora by burning fossil fuels and motor oil which consist of chemical dangerous elements.

Secondly, for this reason, reducing of deathes would be a positive step in saving nature.

If government introduced laws of reducing the number of air travel for business and leisure we would not be so worried about the international statistics of crashes of planes.

On the other hand, it goes without saying that air travel is recognised to be the fastest way of journey.

Having analyiesed these reasons, it worth concluding that it would be simplistic to state categorically that air travel has good or bad impact on the nature.

Nowadays there is one of the most popular and serious topics - is global warming and chemical pollution of our planet.

That's because the governments suggest various sollutions, for example, to minimize the number of business and leisure air travels.

Also, if we look at this problem more deeply and so through the statistics of the most dangerous types of transports for air, we will find out that air travel isn't a leader.

Cars bring much bigger amount of pollution to the air.

However, it's more difficult to reduce the amount of personal transport, than a number of air travel.

Actually, we have some examples, when the governments reduced the amount of cars in cities, but it was made to make a transport system more free and not for minimizing an air pollution.

However, as I said, it can't change a situation of air pollution or global warming as far as such changes are too minimal.

In conclusion, I'd like to say that providing such serious changes without deep, constructive analyze, will lead to crusial faults.

It means, that if governments is going to reduce an amount of air travels, they should listen to all the opinions and all the side should be agreed with final solution.

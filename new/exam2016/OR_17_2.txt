To my mind, the problem must be solved with the help of energy-eddicient planes and ecologically clean fuel rather than by introducing restricting laws.

One of the possible solutions of the problem is the governmental invention, that is a law which will limit air travel for some "not important" purposes.

If the governments behaved as said above, the majority of people would protest and try to cancel the law.

It is very natural, since people understand that there are other, more rational means of decreasity air pollution and preventry global warming.

The air is beiry polluted not by the existence of the plane itself, but the smoke that it produces during the flight.

The main difference of such planes from the existing one will be the construction, that is, the planes will use fuel as a second form of energy and the solar energy will be the main one.

To sum up, I0 would like to mention that the strategy of making enery-efficient planes is much more perspective than the strategy of law introduction.

Each one of them has disadvantages as the cost of doing research and perception by people.

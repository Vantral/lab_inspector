Of course, moving the business to developing countries has many advantages.

To begin with, when companies develop business in poorer countries, they provide local people with working places, benefiting both workers and the developing countries' economy.

In addition, in poorer regions people do not demand high salaries, which allows international companies save money for further development and innovations.

Moreover, it is much easier for local people to find a good job or to start running their own business after working for an international company and gaining useful experience.

However, we cannot help facing many problems connected with companies who move their factories to poorer countries.

First of all, as people in poorer countries have few working places, they are ready to do hard work for rather little money, so companies move their businesses there to enrich themselves without paying attention to the international standarts of working process.

Secondly, the quality of produce, which is made by workers with low qualification, is rather likely to suffer.

For example, many brends lable the products which are made in Europe or the USA and sell them for much higher prices, as the customers are sure of the quality.

Overall, it can be stated that moving the process of production to poorer countries has various advantages and disadvantages.

In my opinion, it is better to provide people with working places anyway.

Hopefully, in the future it will become possible to reduce the negative aspects of doing business in developing countries by raising international standarts and paying more attention to maintain them.

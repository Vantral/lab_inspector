One of the most dangerous sources is air travelling that is need to be regulate by new laws in order to reduce the number of pollutions.

Every day a huge amount of air crafts are flying from one destination to another leaving a great deal of pollution to the air and governments are able to create some restrictions for the environmental protection.

At first, some air movements are really unnecessary when a big planes are not full of passengers and have a lot of space inside.

For instance, if we will send only one but fully filled plane instead of several half-blanked it will help to decline air pollutions.

Another point is to use alternative sourses of energy that do not pollute our space in a such dangerous way.

On the other hand, these restrictions are seemed not so relevant for our life because air travels are a significant part of people's existence and pollutions from air planes are not the main cause of the environmental crisis.

A lot of others types of transport give not less pollutions than aircrafts, so oceans, rivers, seas are in trouble too.

To sum it all up, as you see the problem has two sides but I still prefer thinking that hardly had we introduced laws and other restrictions for using air crafts we would hace a chance to save a planet and it's natural and environmental sigh.

And, of course, air transport has a really large influence on such problems.

But at the same time different kinds of prohibitions, which governments can introduce today, cannot solve such environmental problems like global warming and air pollution.

First of all, there are a large amount of different factors, which have influence on such problems.

In conclusion, there are a lot of different factors witch may have influence on such environmental problems like air pollution and global warming, we don't have to talk only about air transport.

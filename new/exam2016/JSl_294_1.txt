For instance, men aged from 16 to 24 spend almost twice as much time exercising as men from 25 to 34.

However, as men vetire at the age of 65, they spent doing more sports and average time grows from 52,7 minutes to 60,5.

This is probably due to worse health conditions of elderly people.

In conclusion, the diagram proves that as people grow elder, they have less free time to spent doing sports and exercises despite the fast that middle- aged and elderly people and to do more sports to remain in good shape.

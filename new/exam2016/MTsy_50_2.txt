In the same tie other people think that this way of travelling is the most convinient, that's why they are not going to change the way they usually travel.

First of all, I agree with these people because I suppose that plane is the fastest and one of the most comfortable way of travelling.

According to my opinion different fabrics make much more harm for our nature.

In this case it should be more important to think about all these fabrics, also about cars which cause global warming too.

In other words, there are so many causes which are more important than air travelling about which we just don't mention.

Due only to that fact, that our nature spoils by airtravelling, the amount of flyghts of rich people should be reduced.

Summing up, I'd like to say that, of course, we have to take care about our nature, about everything that makes our life easier.

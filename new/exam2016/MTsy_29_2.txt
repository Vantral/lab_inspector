Some people regard air travelling as a way of air polluting and one of reasons of global warming.

For example, reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure.

The question which is arising is whether to limit the amount of acting transport or not to.

Second reason which I am not for reducing the number of flights by is that, on my opinion, there is not alternative kind of transport.

Thus, I believe that such measures as banning of a part of flights is not the optimal measure, because it seems to me that there are other ways of pollution which are more detrimental, and in order to save the environment, one should begin with them.

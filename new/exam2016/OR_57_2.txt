There is no doubt that using of modern technologies influences the environment significantly and air travelling is not an exception.

Probably, the most effective solution of this problem is not legal restriction or reducing of air travelling, but using of environmentally-friendly fuel and materials for contrasting planes.

To conclude, I would like to note that it seems to be impossible to decrease the level of air travels or fully deny from them in a modern world, but governments and society should try to get compromise and take measures for saving the environment from negative influence of human activity.

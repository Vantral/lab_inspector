In my opinion, the periods of sentence should be discussed to avoid negative effects of the punishment.

As for the society, a longer period of sentence cannot put pressure on them; therefore, victimsand their relatives can apply for a psychological help during the period of sentence without thinking over the revenge.

Though the trainings and rehabs may be considered less effective, these ways of punishment can change the attitude of the prisoners.

Instead of prolonging the punishment, one can introduce more educational assessments and trainings to be sure that the prisoner will tend to normal life in future.

 In my opinion, strict measures can have a devastating effect on human mind, namely, a longer sentence can damage social nets in the society.

As everyone has a chance to recover and stick to a normal life, there should be introduced trainings and recover organizations.

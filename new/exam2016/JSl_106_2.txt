Secondly, movement to developing countries gives a company a chance to take the lead on the local market, because if such a country is poorer so the company will not have a trouble contesting with other analoges.

Then reckon that the movement can cause some troubles like problem with adoption to a new resources, new markets or even rules, so that movement can lead to a company's destroyment.

I disagree, though, because changing for any company is a big step, and a wise director should think about all features and possible risks before.

When all was said and done, I would like to stress that changing place for a company has more advantages than disadvantages but if the director do not make his best to make better success, the company will be in troubles, obviously.

This graph introduces information about funding a certain type of energy.

The data is separated by years (from 2006 to 2013) and also indicates three different rates.

So it all started with 100$ Bn followed by a stabile growth untill the year of 2008 when the investment reached 171$ Bn worldwide.

After that funding slightly fell down, but that lasted only for one year.

From 2009 to 2011 a rapid growth takes place.

The graph shows that in 2011 funding reached its highest rate, that is 279$ Bn.

For some reason these numbers then fell down to 214$ Bn in 2013.

The way it all developed in developed and developing countries separatelt is almost the same exept for the fact that in developing countries the growth didn't stop in years 2008, as it still contined from the very beginning to 2011.

Moreover, the fall in these states begun later that in developed countries.

To be more exact, it happened a year later.

We can also see that those investments in renewable energy has always been almost twice as big as the ones of developing countries.

Taking everything into consideration, I would say that the tendencies all over the world are quite the same when not taking the amount of funding into account.

Some people believe that traveling by plain polluts the air and became one of the reason of global warming.

That is why they mean that governments should accept few laws about limiting of air transporting for business and leisure.

From my point of view it is impossible to reduce the number of air traveling wich are unnecessary for governments as business and leisure.

Firstly, because it will reduce right of people who has need in air traveling.

Reducing it means to make their work less helpfull or successful for them and first of all for the society.

Secondly, I think that humanity is able to reduce an air pollution by other ways as improbing the sience or using energy more egurecy.

In addition, sientists open that the main reason of air pollution in nowadays is gas from cars not from airplans.

That is why important for people to pay their attention to the way of using cars instead air transport and try to invelope how to use solar energy or other resurces.

I can not agree with opposite point of view because it is impossible in nowadays to introduce laws wich will reduce human rights in moving whatever they want.

This argument depends on our legal system where human rights and freedom are the main purposes.

To sum, I need to say that in 20th centery people increased air transporting system in that large that it is impossible to imagine our world without that kind of transport.

That is why it will be easier to find another way of reducing the level of air pollution.

On the hand there are several advantages to this point.

Firstly, in poor countries local workers are much more cheaper, due to the low price for work international companies gain a huge profit.

On the other hand there are also several disadvantages that may outweigh the advantages.

The first one is quality of product.

The level of knowledge of local workers or their skills is not always as high as possible.

To compare with international specialists the local workers skills are very poor.

Due to it quality of production decrease.

The second one is cargo.

Retaining money on work will not retain them on cargo.

It requires a huge amount of money and power to get a product to consumer.

To sum it up, I suppose disadvantages outweigh the disadvantages due to the final price.

Employment of local workers and increasing production are very significant.

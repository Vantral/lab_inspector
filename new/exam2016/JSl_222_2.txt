Nowadays almost everybody is concerned about global warming, mass media shouts it everywhere, so some people believe that government should restrict air travelling by introduction the new law.

Firstly, government should not make people to reduce the quantity if their flight unless they are not ready to suggest the type od transport as convenient as plane.

Now the prices of plane and train tickets are approximately equal, but the duration of flight and train travel are much different.

Thus government and society should think not of restriction as the solution of the problem, but of new ways to travel, for example, to make train cheaper and faster.

Secondly, reducing air travelling could decreased business activity in country, so it would be harmful for national economy.

Everyday thousands of people make business trips and it will be impossible or much more expensive with that law and high costs for firms are apparent.

All in all, the puring of air is the important thing, however, the number of flight by the law is not the best solution.

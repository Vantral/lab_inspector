Nowadays scientists proved that air travel is one of the reasons of air pollution and global warming.

Due to this fact some people think that governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure.

In my opinion, as a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments have to control this sphere of transport better.

There are several reasons why I think so.

Firstly, air pollution may cause health problems.

It means that governments will have to spend more money on health care programs.

Secondly, global warming caused by planes and other types of air transport is the reason of climate change which is also a negative tendency for all countries and nations.

Thirdly, some countries provide air routes for other countries which means that their territory receives much more negative effects from air travels in comparison with countries which do not sell their air spase.

On the other hand, air travels is a huge industry.

It means that millions of people work in this sphere.

For example, some people works as pilots while others works as engineers and their job is to built new planes.

Cutting the amount of air travel means that all these people will lose their jobs which is undoubtedly bad for society.

Moreover, reducing the amount of air travel will lead to increase in the cost of flights.

In other words, governments will reduce the number of people travelling abroad.

To sum up, there are lots of arguments for and against introducing laws to reduce the amount of air travel.

In my submission, the best way to solve this problem is to invent new type of air pollution and global warming because of some modern technologies.

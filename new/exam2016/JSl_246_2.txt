In modern world plains became common of comfortable transport to travel in long distances.

The main drawback of air travelling for society is the pollution caused by them.

There is a widespread opinion that government should regulate air travels and reduce the pollution by decreasing the number of flights.

I partly agree with the point of view because with air travel popularity many people forgot about other transport for moving outside like trains, ships and cars.

In this way it is often possible to cause less pollution, travel with comfort on short distances and sometimes here a better connection with nature and different cultures by stopping in other towns and cities rather than spending several hours looking in illuminator.

On the other hand, the main advantage of the plains is their mobility.

Sometimes it seems impossible to substitute it with other types of transport when you need to move fast from one place to another to make an important business deal or visit your sick grandmother.

Impossible to argue that moving to the opposite side of the earth without wasting more than 12 hours is a great achievement of scientists progress and it's hart to return to slower ways of travelling.

To sum up, air travel without doubts became a part of our society nowadays and it's a problem to substitute it in most of the cases.

But government may encourage people to use other types of transport when it's possible to pollute air less.

But problems of global warming and pollution are still very important so in my opinion we shold focus on finding the alternative ecological fuel rather than reducing amount of air travel.

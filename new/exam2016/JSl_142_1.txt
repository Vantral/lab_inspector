The presented data illustrates how developed and developing countries were changing their investments in renewable energy, during the period of 8 years.

The line graph depicts a world total investment changing.

The histogram shows changes in both developed and developing countries.

As can be observed, the world total investment was gradually increased during the three years, then it slightly dipped in 2009.

After it, the world total investment in renewable energy significantly surged and we can see the peak of 279$ bn in 2011.

Then it started to fall again and this investment was only 214$ bn in 2013.

As can be seen from the second graph, the amount of investment in renewable energy in developed countries is twice bigger than in developing ones over the hole period.

The exceptions are 2012 and 2013 when developing countries started to invest almost as much as developed ones.

The peak of developed countries' investment is in 2011 almost 200$ bn, the peak of developing countries' investment is in 2012 - slightly bigger than 100$ bn.

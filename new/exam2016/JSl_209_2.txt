According to statistics, the contries, where death penalty is allowing has a less crime percentage rather states, which do not use it but, death penalty is non-ethical and many countries and people will never use this solve.

Fro crime problem with developing of our society people will find a way to make a crime, but also I believe that another persons will always search an alternative ways of reducing crime.

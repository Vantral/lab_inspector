One of these issues is pollutions and global warming by air travel.

First and foremost, air travel is not the only one thing which pollutes our environment.

There are such issues as pollutions by factories, cars, cutting off the trees, etc.

One of the perfect ways to decrease air pollutions is to create or find a new energy resource, technology, which can replace things providing bad conditions to the environment.

In addition, reducing the amount of flights is connected to the consfictuonal right of people.

The last but not least, if government reduce the amount of air travel, people will have to use other ways of travelling.

For instance, travelling by sea also contributes to water pollutions, as other transport does.

The are a lot of ways to cut off pollutions by finding alternative energy sources and improving engineering technologies.

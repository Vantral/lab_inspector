It is easy to agree with the first opinion.

It would be better to check the relevant statistics but it seems reasonable that a lot of crimes are made by recidivist, people who have already broken the law then spend time in a prison and restarted do crimes after deliberation.

And if they stayed more time in prison they maybe would have less time to break the law going out.

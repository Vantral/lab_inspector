In the illustration below we can see some changes connected with the investment in renewable energy through the 7 year period from 2006 to 2013.

From the line graph we can see that the amount of money invested worldwide in energy that can be renewed, grown steadily till 2011, where you can see the peak which illustrates the biggest investment about $ 279 Bn.

Then we can notice a considerable decrease to $ 214 Bn in 2013 that I can connect with the economic problems that happened worldwide.

The information about the type of the countries and the money they spent on the renewable energy is presented in the bar chart.

It is obvious that developing countries spent more money every year and the amount of their investments rose from $ 25 Bn to $ 100 Bn in 2006 and 2012 respectively.

Unfortunately, there was a slight fall in 2013 when the amount of investments was oly about $ 80 Bn.

If you look at the bars that present developed countries, you will see that the changes in investment worldwide are strongly connected with the changes in developed countries.

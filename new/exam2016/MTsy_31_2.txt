Air travel has a lot of advantages and disadvantages but mineses such as air pollution, global warming and others play main roles for life of society in our time.

To sum up, in some situations air transport can help people to solve their problems but I think that you shouldn't use air transport if you have really good different ability to reach the aim so if you will use air transport many times it will give for the nature a lot of negative things then helps for you.

So many people claim that air travel, which makes a significant countribution to air pollution and global warming, should be restricted by governmental laws.

That doesn't mean only personal convenience : an ability to change places quickly makes economic perfomances of firms more effective, reduces transactional costs, presenting benefits to the whole economic system.

Moreover, decrease in use of planes will result in growth of the number of people traveling by cars and by trains which also contribute to air pollution.

Nevertheless, some people may argue that the impact of air travel on environment is too massive to come up with it easily.

Only governmental laws can alfer the situation as the industry itself won't clearly take any actions and people in general are not ready to sacrifise the benefits air travel brings.

There also some disadvantages of moving bussiness to poorer countries.

Firstly, even if you move your business in the developing county, you definitely left the head office in your country.

Having a conclusion, I would like to say that inspite of moving businesses to poorer, developing countries and employ local workers has several disadvantages they are not so important and can be easily solved.

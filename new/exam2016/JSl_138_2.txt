From the other hand, spendings for rebuilding and rerunning the business could be higher.

Nevertheless, it is often claimed that employees from poor countries are being discriminated and have awful conditions at work because nobody could present their interests and fight for their rules.

All in all, I think that relocating the business to poor countries and employing workers from that place has more advantages than disadvantages.

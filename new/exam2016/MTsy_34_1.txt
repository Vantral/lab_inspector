If regions is compared, it can be seen that the number of girls and boys from Africa reduced from 23,7 to 18,2 and from 20 to 14,5 respectively whereas the figure of South Asia's girls and boys by far decreased.

As a result, the amount of girls and boys also decreased from 12,8 to 7,6 and from 10,5 to 7,7 millions respectively.

Taking everything into account, it is obviously that each region had a positive step into education over the period, because less children without access to primary school education.

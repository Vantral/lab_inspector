In my opinion, forcing someone to be a prisoner longer than it used to be would not be very helpful in reducing a percentage of crimes.

To my point of view the best way to reduce crime is building modern prisons which will influence minds of people inside those buildings in a better way.

One example is a system of prisons in Norway, where people can read, work, go to the university and even have a separate house.

Taking everything into consideration I want to say that before giving longer prison sentences we have to look inside this prisons and think about benefits which will have prisoners after their term.

The picture illustrates how the investitions in renewable energy had been changing from 2006 to 2013.

Firstly, we can see an obvious difference between developed and developing countries.

There are much more money are invested in renewable energy in developed countries.

Moreover, investment in developing countries was slowly increasing up to 2012 and than it had a little fall in 2013.

While in developed countries we can notice some jumps, just like in the world total.

The highest point at the graph is a 2011 year and the investment reached 279$ bn there in total.

To sum up, in spite of noticeable jumps major of time the investment in renewable energy had been raising in particular period.

Developed countries surely had made significant invest in the energy and played an important role in worldwide statistics.

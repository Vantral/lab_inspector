The most fascinating results were discovered in South Asia region, where overall rate of uneducated children rapidly dropped from point of 32,7 percent to incredibly low 9,9 percent - that's the lowest rate in this study.

Speaking of the last, but not the least region of this study, Africa, it is noticeable that constantly poor level of education in this region might be enhanced in future, because now overall percentage of those children, who do not have access to primary education is on the same level as in 2000 in South Asia.

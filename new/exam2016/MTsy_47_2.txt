Because, on the one hand, airplanes threw some gases to the atmosphere, and it can damage the ecology.

And the damage effects from using this kind of fuel are much less than the pollution, providing by using cars, working manifactures, e.

Becaue the most of gases, which is left by airplanes in the air don't get down to the Earth, but mix with air on the level of around 10000 metres.

Of coure using airplanes can cause som bad effect on the ecology of the Earth, but there are reasons that are much more important, and governments should pay more attention for them.

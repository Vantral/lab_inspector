It is of exceptional importance to add that the amount of money spent by developed countries has been always bigger than of developing ones.

The main trend that occur was the slight increasing of investment in renewable energy from 2006, but by 2008 it started to remain stable.

Eventually, it is important to mention that the difference between investment rate among developing and developed countries was stably decreasing from three times differ in 2006 to 0,5 time differ in 2013.

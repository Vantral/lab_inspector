This is a fact that air buses are causes of air pollution and global warming, so, I suppose that air travelling should be regulated by goverments.

Since the middle of 20th century air plains are the best way to trip between countries.

So only goverments can regulate this by different laws, which reduce the amount of air travel.

Air travelling should be used only when people need to go to thousands kilometres and using of another transport is impossible.

There are so many risks for air companies and economics of countries on common, however climate problems should be in priority.

Also the significant reason to regulate amount of air travels is creating new ways of travelling, which are much more ecological.

while we have very convinient way to travel as air travelling, nobody sees the reasons to create more ecological transport, because it needs goverment sponsorship and much time to realise it.

If it will be reduced, the govermens will start to give money for creating new ways, so it will better for ecology.

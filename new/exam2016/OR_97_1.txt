The data are available from the period of 2000 to 2012 in Africa, South Asia and the other parts of the world.

As an overall trend, it is obvious that the situation in Africa can be taken as the most critical simply due to its almost 45 million children without an access to education in 2000.

However, in 12-year time, the situation has improved with the approximate 33 million children which was the same to the South Asia in 2000.

Interestingly, there is no sufficient difference towards the issue of the gender with the approximate 50 50 percentage both for girls and boys not depending on the region or a time period.

Finally, the most dramatic change took place in the South Asia, resulting in the almost 5-times decline in the number of girls without an access to education.

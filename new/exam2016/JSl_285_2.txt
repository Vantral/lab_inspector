Secondly, these social websites provided with special functions (such as "to share" and so on) make it easier to spread information : you have an opportunity to share some facts with both your friends or just people who yo do not know.

On the other hand, for some people social media means only entertainment.

The reason is that it is widely believed that social websites are not reliable sources of information, which contain many biased opinions as everybody can share their point of view.

Furthermore, using social media many people cannot  focus on essential or useful information because they are easily distracted by their friends writing them too often.

That is why, sharing knowledge by social media tends to be useless.

To sum up, I would like to say that social websites may be used on various ways it depends on a personality of a user, however, I believe that social media such as Facebook is created sharing knowledge as I suppose that entertainment online is not a good idea, people should do it in other way (such as meeting with each other).

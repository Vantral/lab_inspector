So then a lot of people firmly believe that governments should limit air travelling by low restrictions.

To begin with it is worth mentioning that air travelling has lots of benefits that cannot be substituted by other more or less environmnentalal friendly means of transports.

First of all I would point out the time economy which is relevant to be emphasized as one of the proses of air transportation.

Law restrictions aimed to limit this sphere will definitely cause more negative consequences than positive ones.

It will be caused by limitations of business travelling because mainly consensus concerning exported or imported production can be reachd during formal meeting located in the owner's country.

To put everything in a nutshell I would conclude that limiting air travelling is not the most profitable idea due to wide range of significant negative consequences.

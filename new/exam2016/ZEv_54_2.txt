One group of people think that the best way - is to give longer prison sentences, but other group of people believe, that alternative ways are better.

On the one hand, I agree with first group, because the longer prison sentences can help us to avoid re-offering.

However there are a lot of alternative ways of reducing crime, for example work with young people.

In my point of view, we can use complex solve for reduce crime.

Our children should learn laws in school, it also help us to reduce crime.

Also we can make document films about life in prison and show it in schools.

In conclusion, I think that both of them opinions are effective, but we should find and develop new alternative ways to reduce crime.

Some people believe that air travel has no effect on the condition of our atmosphere while others are absolutely sure about strong negative effects of this type of travelling and vote for prohibiting wide usage of planes for business and holiday trips.

But if planes cause air pollution, even if less than other transport - it is worth solving this problem from the side of air travel, too.

It is known that air travelling is harmful for the environment some people say that governments should make laws that restrict this sphere.

In this essay I will try to describe how the problem can be solved.

Firstly, the problem isn't widely known.

Even though a lot of people care about ecology, they will still use air travel, because they didn't know that it harms the environmental.

So, governments should use social advertising to make the problem commonly known.

Secondly, nowadays air travelling is the cheapest and the fastest way to get to any destination.

It is often fair even for small distances expensive taking larger taxes ( as an example) this would weaken the economy, because modern economy is highly depended on developed transport system.

Therefore the only way is developing other kinds at transportation for example trains.

Good examples are japan thing and some European countries, where train system is modern and relatively cheap and train can alternate up to 800 km/h.

furthermore, governments should also stimulate companies to invest in projects that develop eco-friendly plains.

For example, there already is a plain that contribute minimum fuel using solar energy.

The salienty can hardly exist without air travel, it should be developed to become more ecological.

To sum up, the society nowadays is highly depends in air travel even though it is harmful for environment, government activity should be aimed on long-term benefit, so that society wouldn't has economical issues and won't cause dramatic changes in the environment.

So the governments politics shouldn't be aimed only in reducing the amount of air travel, because the main goal is developing the technology.

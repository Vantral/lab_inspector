I completely disagree with the idea that government should reduce the number of air flights in case of global warming and air pollutions, because I believe that there are another ways to save environment from pollutions.

Air plane is really fast and it can take people in place that another transport can't , so laws to reduce the amount of air travel will reduce people freedom too.

I think that people should have opportunity to choose any place they want and any transport to get in this place.

Socndly, air pollutions can be reduced by the means of science and technology, but not by the reduced flights that lead to problems with transportation.

World community should be cleverer and for the first time while there are no such ecoplanes make not laws but advertisment that will tell people about pollutions that air transport make, maybe some people will choose buses or trains if they understand that serious problem with ecology.

In conclusion, I believe that air transport is most comfortable transport that make people free and government should not reduce it but help it to be more ecological by supporting science in the air sphere.

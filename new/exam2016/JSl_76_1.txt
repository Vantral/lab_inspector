The most noticeable point is that developed countries invested much more than developing ones during the whole period.

In 2006 they invested about $ 25 billions in renewable energy, while in 2012 this amount was more than $ 100 bn.

After 2012 there was a decline so in 2013 developing countries invested less than $ 100 bn.

To start from about $ 80 bn the sum of investment reached its peak in 2011 a bit less than $ 200 bn were invested.

In 2006 the sum was $ 100 bn, from 2009 to 2011 it dramatically grew and reached a peak with $ 279 bn.

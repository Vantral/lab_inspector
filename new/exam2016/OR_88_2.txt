In the light of this fact, a lot of people claim that air travel is a main source of such pollution and government should change the legislation to reduce business and leisure flights.

However, the problem of pollution is much bigger than people's entertainment and business, this, governments should make some measures to prevent further pollion of the air.

In general, I would say that reducing or prohibiting leisure and business flights is not the solution for the problem.

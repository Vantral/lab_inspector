First of all, it is clearly seen from the graph that starting from the year 2006 the amount of investment in developing countries saw an upward trend : starting from a bit less than 25 $ Bn investment gradually increased to about 110 $ Bn and then in 2013 it decreased to approximately 80 $ Bn.

As for developed countries, overall amount of investment was significantly bigger but the figures were fluctuating reaching their highest point of about 175 $ Bn in 2011 and the lowest point of approximately 100 $ Bn in 2007.

The figures for world total were flactuating as well with the highest amount of investment of 279 $ Bn in 2011 and the lowest of 168 $ Bn in 2009.

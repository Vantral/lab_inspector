However, some people think that it is too much air travel nowadays and that governments have to reduce the time of such type of travel for leisure and business by making special laws.

In my opinion, it is not a good idea.

Firstly, because travelling by plane is the fastest way to get to far destinations and sometimes it is very necessary for some people.

He was going to his motherland every two weeks to see his family, and if air travel is reduced, he will spend a week to travel to Australia by alternative ways of transport.

Secondly, the statistics show that air travel is the safest way of travelling comparing, for instance, to going by car.

However, a lot of air travel is unnecessary because of a lot of fuel using for planes.

Moving back to positive sides of travelling by plane, I can see that this way of transport is the most convenient for business, because during the flight nothing interrupts you in comparison to train, car or bus, where there are crowds of people and people and you can not concentrate or relax.

In conclusion I would like to say that, to my mind for several reasons there is now need to make special laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure f

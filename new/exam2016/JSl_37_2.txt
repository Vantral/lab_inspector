There is an opinion that the amount of air travel should be reduced in the case it influences badly the atmosphere and leads some global problems.

Furthermore, reducing the number of plains may lead to the increase of the usage of other kinds of transport, for instance, cars and trains which also need fuel and cause air polution and even global warming.

To sum up, the idea of introducing the laws of decline the level of air travel is not the main and the most effective way of reducing the air polution and avoiding the process of global warming.

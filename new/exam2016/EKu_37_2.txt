There are also people who suppose that we should find other solutions for this problem.

From my point of view, it is not a good idea to give long prison sentences to the people, who are guilty for breaking the law or who have committed a serious offense.

To begin with, the living conditions in the prison may affect badly the individuality of people, because when a person is under the prison for a long period of time he starts to forget how to communicate and socialize with other people.

Furthermore, he starts to forget how the world around him looks like, and it might become really a difficult problem to him to rehabilitate after he will be allowed to go free.

Nevertheless, there are people who think that the best way to struggle against the problems connected with crime is to place people in prison for longer periods.

I do not really agree with that opinion and I am sure that there should be found alternative ways of reducing crime - community services, improving the police forces and so on.

I believe that our government should immediately take measures against this problem of the reduction of crime and improve the situation with all the possiblemethods.

The line graph and bar chart given to us describe the changes in renewable energy's investment in the world un the period from 2006 till 2013.

 According to the line graph we can say that firstly there was a stable increasing from 100 $ bn till 171 $ bn.

But it was noticed that the level of investment remained the same between 2008 and 2009.

After that there was a gradually increasing and the sum of investment had a peak in 2011, and consisted 279 $ bn.

Finally, it became to fall stadily till the end of 2013.

If we look at bar chart, we can see that developed countries invested in renewable energy more money than developing ones during the whole considered period.

At the beginning of the this period the difference between these types of countries was too noticable.

But this tendency has changed by the end of 2013, and the difference was about 40 $bn.

To sum up, I can say, that the main tendency of this graph is increasing.

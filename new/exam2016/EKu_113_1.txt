Obviously, two data points are not enough to make a significant conclusion, but it's possible to infer that Facebook users are switching to mobile devices, and also that its user base is growing : the figures indicate that the number of mobile users is growing significantly faster than the number of desktop users is dropping.

Sharing photos and videos is the answer where the greatest disparity between male and female respondents can be observed : 15% more female respondents consider it one of their main reasons for using Facebook.

This gives us insight into the methods used in this survey : perhaps each respondent could give an arbitrary number of reasons for using Facebook, and men gave less answers in general.

Perhaps we are only seeing a slice of the whole survey : certainly it seems strange that there is no single reason which men would find more important than women.

However, without being acquainted with the methodology of this survey, we cannot propose a single satisfactory explanation for this disparity in the data.

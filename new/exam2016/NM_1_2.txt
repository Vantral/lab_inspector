Nowadays due to the development of oliverse types of transportation, the modern society faces a significant provlem of air pollution.

The ehaeest emissions from air kinds of transport undoubtedly would lead to the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and different elements of pollution.

Therefore, some people hold the opinion that the government is able to ban some kinds of air transportation in order to reduce the amount of waste.

One of the most striking features of this problem is that air transportation is preferable among the residents.

Althought, this kind of travelling is a great deal more convinient, the decline in it's popularity would cause some benefits for the envitonment.

For instance, one could assume, that the atmosphere would contain less harmful emissions.

Moreover, if the government intriduces a special law, the other types of transport should be also developed.

In other words, people should get a good alternative to air transport, such as trains.

Despite the fact that the law might reduce the number of business and leisure air travellings, there are the other types of air transport usage.

As a result, a chellenge of environmental polluting would not be completely solved.

Furthermore, other kinds of activities such as automobiles or working of factories also influence the growth of harmful elements in the atmosphere, so, the law of the government would not change the situation completely.

To sum up, all things considered, there are a lot of air travells that are not needed.

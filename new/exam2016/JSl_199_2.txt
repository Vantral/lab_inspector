While it is true that soft punishment is insufficient, like $7 time for driving 20 kmph over the speed limit in Russia, when the punishment harsher, the situation is not so obvious.

It is not likely, that year decision is going to change it the new legistation pushes 50 year sentence as a punishment - both of this basically seem to be "forever".

This includes the direct costs of punishment system to the expayers, the benefits lost, because people in prison are not working, al least productivity, the costs added by rehabilitation after the long sentence, and the poisonous society, that is in prison.

Overall, longer sentences will hardly reduce any crime while costing a lot of whole society.

Surely, with development of high-speed ground travel, such as faster trains like ICE, the need for aviation slowly disappears in most developed countries high-speed train networks offer the same routes, but trains are cheaper, more ecological, more comfortable and sometimes even faster : in most cities rail terminals are situated in the center, while the airports are usually located far in suburbs.

The second disadvantage of an aeroplane is comfort and security : passengers are suited in far more narrow space, which deprives of personal comfort and makes survival case of emergency more complicated, which is an actual problem, taking in account the increase in number of plane crashes and terrorist attacks.

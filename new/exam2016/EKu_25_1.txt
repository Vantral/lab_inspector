The information given demostrates changes in investment in renewable energy all over the world from 2006 to 2013 in developed and developing countries, as well as a world total.

It can be deduced from the graph that there were a stable growth in investment from 2006 to 2009 (100 $ Bn and 168 $ Bn relatively), and investment in developing countries was growing steadily, while the figures in developed countries remained stable.

Later, the amount of investment increased dramatically to 227 $ Bn in 2010 and 279 $ Bn in 2011, mostly because of significant growth in investment in developed countries.

Overall, after analysing the information given, it can be stated that the world total in the investment in renewable energy increased at more than 2 times from 100 $ Bn in 2006 to 214 $ Bn in 2013 : there was a steady growth until 2011, then a world total started decreasing roughly at the same pace.

There are two main points of view about longening the prisons sentences : the first one is that it is the best way to reduce crime, and the second one -- that better alternatives of reducing crime exist.

As for the first opinion, it is easy to understand where it comes from.

If you sentence a crime for longer term in jail, there is less time for him left to make more crimes when he is out.

On the other hand, prisons nowadays are not the places where you could be taught not to commit crimes.

A lot of self-education books tell us, that you must be surrounded by people who encourage you to be the better version of yourself.

But for a person in a prison it is hard to find any other surrounding that the one that consists only of the people who has comitted crime.

For me it is the reason for searching better ways of reducing crime.

I think, Norwegian jails is a good example of ideal ones.

As I have read, prisoners in these jails can work (but not have to) and are paid considered amount of money for their work.

They also can get new profession there, if they want to.

Which means, that after leaving the prison they would have some money and a demandable profession to start a completly new life.

The Norwegian prison is bright and has a big library and lots of others education and sport facilities, which makes it ideal place for person reforming.

I think, person is more tend to commit a crime when he is despirate, when there is nothing to lose for him, when he has no money, no education, no life opportunities.

The other one important trigger for breaking the law is bad people around, for example, people, who was born in a families where one of the parents was sentenced to a prison term are more likely to commit crimes.

That why I believe, that methods, that are used in the Norwegian jails are better, than just giving longer prison sentences.

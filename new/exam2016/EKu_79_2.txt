However, there is no one strategy to improve the cituation, some people suggest that long imprisonment is the best way to prevent the crime as the punishment will distract people from commiting it.

First of all, it matches only prepared crime but not an accidental one and those people who caused death because of their low attention on the road ,for example, are sentensed to the punishment which is very strict.

Other people consider that there are more efficient measures for this problem like helping unprotected social groups of people who are at reask to become a criminal because of their poverty.

Another solution is maintaining social awareness and high level of responsibility among the people, enough to call the police if the crime is commited.

All in all, I think that this problem requires complex and profound solution which unites both points of view and contains social conciousness and protection of human rights as well as sufficient punishment.

As result, the highest proportion of crimes belongs to poorest countries in which the governments do not take actions to solve economical and social problems.

In my opinion, we should take action together to reduce crime by not only prolonging sentences for serious crimes such prison as murders and corrupcy but improving social and economical conditions in the poorest countries and erasing inequities between rich and poor people.

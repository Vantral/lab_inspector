Over the recent years a lot of international companies relocate their businesses to developing countries and hire local workers.

Nowadays such a process is possible due to globalization.

To my mind, there are two ideas of the coin.

 On the one hand, companies' moving has some advantages.

To start with the work force in developing countries is much cheaper than in developed ones.

Therefore, companies' owners have the opportunity to spend extra money on improving work conditions or on advertising.

In addition to this, renting office or building it is more expensive in developed countries than in developing ones usually because of the lack of materials or space.

In than case, international companies can use cheaper developing countries' buildings and spend extra money on improving workers' qualification, for example.

On the other hand, that tendency also has some disadvantages.
<On PRP><the AT0><other AJ0><hand NN1><, PUN><that DT0><tendency NN1><also AV0><has VHZ><some DT0><disadvantages NN2><. SENT>@
The first one is the fact that developed countries' workers are out of the opportunity to be the part of international companies and to gain useful experience.

The second drawback is the fact that local employees usually are worse educated than workers from Europe or the USA.

That can cause a language barrier problem which can in result reduce the efficiency of company's work.

To sum up, I think disadvantages overweigh advantages.

From my viewpoint decision to move a company or not depend on its sphere.

For instance, if an international company specialized in medicine, it will be great to relocate it to India because this sphere is well developed in that country.

But I am sure that when a company owner wants only to reduce the amount of money spent on salaries, the work of his company will not be effective.

At present , there are a lot of air planes and companies that offer servises of air travel to any distanation and it is acessible for everybody.

 To sum up, it should be said that, plane is useful and nesessory transport for modern life and as for me, modern humanity can not avoid and reduce amount of air travel, because it is convinient, comfortable and accesseble for anyone at anytime.

More than 11 millions of children could additionally get primary education in Africa, in 2012 Africa had the same level of uneducational children as South Asia had in 2000.

It's obvious, that in 2012 the quantity of children without education declined more than three times and that level was below average around the world.

 It must be stated that in 2000 in the rest of world the level of uneducational kids was twice below than in Africa in the same period.

Also it's very important to emphasize that in 2012 all regions beside Africa had approximately the same level of uneducational boys and girls.

To sum up everything, it can be stated that year by year situation with getting primary education improves and it is pleasure to realize that gender has no any impact on this fact.

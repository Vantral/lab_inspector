If we take a look at bar charts representing data for developed and developing countries, we can notice that the amount of investment from developed countries is much more that from developing ones.

The interesting fact is that when the worldwide's and developed countries' investment started to fall down in 2011, developing countries still were investing money in renewable energy for an additional year.

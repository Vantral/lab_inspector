In my opinion, introducing large prison sentences is not good enough, as it has been happening in many countries all over the global, while crime rates are rapidly growing.

Obviously, while long sentences up to life should remain a punishment for the most dangerous falonies it is important that we seek other ways of reducing crime and waking world safer place to live.

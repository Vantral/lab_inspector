The graph illustrates how investment in renewable energy changes in the world as a whole and also in developed and developing countries in the period from 2006 to 2013.

In 2006 2008 and 2010 2011 developed countries invest in renewable energy approximately twice bigger than developing countries while in 2009 and 2012 2013 this values differ not as much as in other years.

So, it is important to notice that the amount of investment almost equal or differ far more less then in other years.

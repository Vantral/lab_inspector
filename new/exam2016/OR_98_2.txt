As for me, I do not think that government should protect the environment by introducing laws that will minimize the amount of air travel.

Firstly, it must be mentioned that it will be unreasonable and irrational to bound the number of flights because this way of traveling is the most convinient one for today and there is no substitution to it.

Despite the fact that some people think air travels are unnecessary and humanity could reduce the amount of them, I disagree with this statement.

To sum up, I think the question of minimizing of plains' flights must be solved amicably and rationally.

Inspite of the fact that plains' wastes hurt the air, governments should not react radically by reducing the number of flights but try to reduce of every air travel.

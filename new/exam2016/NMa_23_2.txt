Probably, I think that government should not reduce the amount of air travel for business, because they gain much money from that by selling and buying sometimes air transport can fly almost empty, without passaegers.

To sum up, I would like to say that air transport has much power to connect countries and it is self-crident tuar positive sides of this process is more important than drawbacks, because these negative sides have more important reasons to became.

First, one can notice that in 2006 developed countries spent more than 50 bn dollars on ecofriendly energy, while developing countries less than 25 billions which made in total 100 billions of dollars.

As time further the line graph gradually increases until 2008 when developing countries invest more than a half of the amount of amount which was spent by developed countries.

Starting from 2011 the line graph plummeted and the total spent on renewable energy looses almost 65 billions.

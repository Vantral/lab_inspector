&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graph provided shows the information about changes in developing and developed countries' worldwide investment in renewable energy during the period from 2006 to 2013 and then gives a conclusion as a world total.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be deduced from the graph that investment in renewable energy in developing countries increased rapidly from about 25 dollars in 2006 to almost 100 in 2013 that shows a four-time increase.

Nevertheless, investment in developing countries rised with some fluctuations, so in 2012 it has reached a number of more than 100 dollars but then decreased to 100 in 2013.

Similarly, investment in renewebale energy in developed countries increased from to 125 in the discussed period.

However, it also had fluctuations; in 2011 developed countries' investment reached 175 which is the best result and then decreased slowly to 125 in 2013.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking about a world total, it should be noticed that it rose rapidly from 100 dollars to 214 during the period discussed that is practically a two-time increase.

Similarly to developing and developed countries' investment in renewable energy a world total has fluctuations.

It should be noticed, that a world total reflects the situation in these countries because it depends on the countries' results.

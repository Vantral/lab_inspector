Finally, today there are government programmes which make the airlines companies install "green" engines in planes in order to reduce the amount of exhausted gases going out in the atmosphere and, as the result, cut down air pollution.

All in all, these factors make us think twice abut the introduction of special laws not to reduce only the amount of air travel but to cut down the amount of waste produced by one plane.

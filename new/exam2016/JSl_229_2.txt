This way of travelling put under threat the wellbeing of the Earth, some people believe that this feature should force governments to establish laws that will decrease the time spent on travelling by planes.

As cars are udes much more often, they pollute air even more, but it is not reasonable to restrict all means of transport just not to pollute the planet.

To conclude, it is evident that planes pollute air and cause global warming, but establishing laws to decline the amount of air travel is not a way of solving this problem, because people are eligible to choose means of transport that is most appropriate for their needs.

Here I would like to write about the problem of reducing crime and give my opinion about it.

Many people think that the best way of reducing crime is to give longer prison sentences.
<Many DT0><people NN0><think VVB><that CJT><the AT0><best AJS><way NN1><of PRF><reducing VVG><crime NN1><is VBZ><to TO0><give VVI><longer AJC><prison NN1><sentences NN2><. SENT>@
They think so because there are many cases when prisoners become really different person in a better way after a long sentence.
<They PNP><think VVB><so AV0><because CJS><there EX0><are VBB><many DT0><cases NN2><when CJS><prisoners NN2><become VVB><really AV0><different AJ0><person NN1><in PRP><a AT0><better AJC><way NN1><after PRP><a AT0><long AJ0><sentence NN1><. SENT>@
They become better because they have more time to think about what they have done, they try their best to become a new person with a new life.
<They PNP><become VVB><better AJC><because CJS><they PNP><have VHB><more DT0><time NN1><to TO0><think VVI><about PRP><what DTQ><they PNP><have VHB><done VDN><, PUN><they PNP><try VVB><their DPS><best AJS><to TO0><become VVI><a AT0><new AJ0><person NN1><with PRP><a AT0><new AJ0><life NN1><. SENT>@
Also, long prison sentences are good because there are such persons who can't live in a normal world with laws and morals.
<Also AV0><, PUN><long AJ0><prison NN1><sentences NN2><are VBB><good AJ0><because CJS><there EX0><are VBB><such DT0><persons NN2><who PNQ><ca VM0><n't XX0><live VVI><in PRP><a AT0><normal AJ0><world NN1><with PRP><laws NN2><and CJC><morals NN2><. SENT>@
So it will be better for all if this kind of prisoners stayed in prisons for a long time.
<So AV0><it PNP><will VM0><be VBI><better AJC><for PRP><all DT0><if CJS><this DT0><kind NN1><of PRF><prisoners NN2><stayed VVN><in PRP><prisons NN2><for PRP><a AT0><long AJ0><time NN1><. SENT>@
However, there are people who believe that there are better, alternative ways of reducing crime.
<However AV0><, PUN><there EX0><are VBB><people NN0><who PNQ><believe VVB><that CJT><there EX0><are VBB><better AJC><, PUN><alternative AJ0><ways NN2><of PRF><reducing VVG><crime NN1><. SENT>@
They think in such way because now psyhologists have many different unique methods that can help prisoners to become better even without longer sentences.
<They PNP><think VVB><in PRP><such DT0><way NN1><because CJS><now AV0><psyhologists NN2><have VHB><many DT0><different AJ0><unique AJ0><methods NN2><that CJT><can VM0><help VVI><prisoners NN2><to TO0><become VVI><better AV0><even AV0><without PRP><longer AJC><sentences NN2><. SENT>@
Such methods can be more resultful because prisoners will have a chance to change their thoughts and find solutions of their problemps with the help of specialits.
<Such DT0><methods NN2><can VM0><be VBI><more AV0><resultful AJ0><because CJS><prisoners NN2><will VM0><have VHI><a AT0><chance NN1><to TO0><change VVI><their DPS><thoughts NN2><and CJC><find VVB><solutions NN2><of PRF><their DPS><problemps NN2><with PRP><the AT0><help NN1><of PRF><specialits NN2><.

Also, there are prisons in which prisoners are not living in a routine thinking about ways to escape.
<Also AV0><, PUN><there EX0><are VBB><prisons NN2><in PRP><which DTQ><prisoners NN2><are VBB><not XX0><living VVG><in PRP><a AT0><routine NN1><thinking VVG><about PRP><ways NN2><to TO0><escape VVI><. SENT>@
For example, there is a prison in Phillipines in which prisoners dance instead of simple walks.

In this prison the most dangerous prisoners are becoming more peacefull and friendly.
<In PRP><this DT0><prison NN1><the AT0><most AV0><dangerous AJ0><prisoners NN2><are VBB><becoming VVG><more AV0><peacefull AJ0><and CJC><friendly AJ0><. SENT>@
In conclusion, I would like to write that I think that such ways of changing people in prisons like in Phillipines are more succesful and probaply it will really reduce crime rates in the future.

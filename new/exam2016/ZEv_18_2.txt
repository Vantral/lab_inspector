So, government should try to stop this threat by reducing the amount of air travels not to allow people to become the victims of pollution.

Moreover, there are thousands of scientists, who try to find natural sources of energy for planes and cars.

If it do not do it, in the next century our society will appear on the stage of extinction and the scientists will not be able to give us a safety source of power.

Despite the fact that our world is under the danger, our society is full of egoistic individuals, who only care about themselves.

In this case, some restrictions on air travels may affect negatively their business and life which is full of freedom now.

However, although such solution to introduce special law of air travel is unbeneficial for our socity, but it is only the one way to save our future generations.

To sum up, doubtless, it will be difficult for people, who used to meet all their needs, to reduce their plane travels, but I believe that only such measures will help to avoid the threat of global warming.

Today, a great number of air travel is made that impacts on our environment and causes air pollution and global warming.

Therefore, governments should introduce laws, in order to decline the amount of travel by air for such reasons as business and entertainment.

To begin with, plane is one of the most popular way of travelling that requires burning a large number of fuel.

Besides, ecological problems, which are caused by using plane, influence healths of people.

This is really a serious problem because every region of our planet get used to own weather conditions.

However, air travel is one of the most faster and comfortable way for travelling.

Thanks to planes, it is posible to get to the other corner of the planet for some hours, while you have to spend significantly more time to travel by bus or train.

Besides, travel by air is one of the most safe way of moving because you can not get to the accident.

To conclude, I would like to say, I somewhat agree that although plane is fast, comfortable and safe mean of transport, it causes serious ecological problems which can destroy our planet and effect on our health so government schould introduce laws to reduce mount of air travel.

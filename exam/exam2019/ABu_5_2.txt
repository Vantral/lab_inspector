It is popularly believed that it is impossible to help all the people around the world, that is why government should concentrate on the problems of its own country. I completely agree with this statement and there are several reasons for that. 
Firstly, each country has its own government which is supposed to take care of the population it leads. This means, that there are particular duties and functions which the government must follow. For example, to provide the nation with social security, health care, work places, and other services humans need. Moreover, if the government do not adress people's needs, it greatly looses their trust. Consequently, there are appearing a number of misunderstandings, conflicts, and other issues in the country. 
Secondly, reaching out to people of other countries can result in huge budget spendings. In addition, this money can be directed to the improvement of the people's living contitions who dwell there. For example, some counties help to others, while people in their own ones are suffering from diseases, unemployment, and other issues. Furthermore, making its own country totally prorperous and wealthy, the government can raise his nation's positions in the international arena. It will show the prosperity and wellbeing of the country comparing to others. 
To sum up, the government first of all should focus on the helping people of its own country, as it has certain responsibilities for its nation and in order to avoid conflicts and other problems. Additionally, putting the problems of its people on the first place can improve the govenment's status and its positions in the world.

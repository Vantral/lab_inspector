In the contemporary world, private companies are taking more initiative in sponsoring scientific research than the government. They are funding scientists and giving grants to scholars to encourage them to carry out research in the field of science. Such a situation has its own upsides and downsides. 
There are a plethora of advantages to this situation. To begin with, private firms provide much more attractive offers to scientists. Their grants are usually higher than that of the government's. In addition to that, they also offer highly-paid jobs to engineers and other scientists in their companies. Also, they organize interesting competitions among scientists and students in order to bring out the best discoveries. 
On the other hand, complete private funding in science does have certain drawbacks. Firstly, private organizations fund only those branches of science that are commercially rewarding like chemistry, technology, biology etc. The fields of science like marine biology and astronomy that are not beneficial commercially are not funded by them. Moreover, due to competition among private companies, they want that the scientists they sponsor not to reveal their discoveries to the whole world and use it only for the benefit of their company. Such tendencies of secrecy are bad for the scientific development at a global level. 
To sum up, sponsorship of scientists by private firms is very popular today but it has certain disadvantages. It might be beneficial to scientists at an individual level, as they are paid better, but on a global level it is not good for scientific development. Its advantages do not outweigh its disadvantages that hinder the growth of scientific discoveries due to competition and secrecy.

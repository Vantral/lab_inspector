In our hectic time people think more and more about researches and diverse breakthroughs in the sphere of science. This topic is actual for governments, but private companies pay more attention to this question. 
There is a great variety of reasons why it is more profitable. If private componies are interested in scientific researches they will pump money in science. Consequently, they will help governments to develop science, to improve the quality of scientific equipment and their working conditions. For instance, especially in small towns it will be effective, because there people have good potencial but low feasibilities. Private companies will help these small towns to develope their working conditions and as a result they gain their scientific goals. Secondly, it will increase the educational level in private companies, as they will learn something new and develop themsselves. With the help of these researches, they can start to work with new technologies and the quality of their work will improve. 
However, there are some drawbacks of this statement. The major downside of this trend is that private companies can use the results of scientific researches for their own advantage. It is paramaunt to mention, that science is not a bussiness or a tool for advertising. All the results of researches and new devices that people have descovered should be shared with the government. And only if the government authorities allow private companies to use them, they can be used. Private componies have to do more for their development as well as for development of the government. 
To conclude, by and large the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the governmenment should allow private componies to carry out scientific researches. It is hoped, that it will improve the quality of work in private companies, develop the sphere of science and increase public interest to work in this field.

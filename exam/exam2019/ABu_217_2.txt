Everyone's know that family plays one of the major roles in our life, especially, in the childhood. It is vital to understand what is more benefecial in the formation of child's personality whenever there is a heated debate the choice between family and outside the house' nurturing. 
Some people strongly believe that parents still serve as the most influencial power to their children, making a lot of affort to bring him/her up. Moreover, they believe that only parents could nurture their child in a fairly sufficient way. Studies have shown that ancestors and parents are prone to understand their child better than anyone else, taking into account all his/her pecularities, mindset and specific traits of character. Obviously, it is much for parets to raise their child as a decent person, trying to form his/her take on life and to persuade him/her to become honest, compassionate person, learning how to reach a compromise and do not argue for the sake of arguing. 
However, others claim that the most beneficial method to nurture a child is school and outside life. They consider school being the most effective and sufficient way to achieve goals and percieve social status. Moreover, people regard school as the "alma mater" where children learn to become responsible not only for yourself but also for others. 
Personally, I believe that both parents and school are equally important and prominent in nurturing children as they combine and devise specific activities to adress children's needs and form his/her personality and features of character. 
Taking everything into account, it is worth mentioning that we cannot diminish or discard the role of each of these aspects as they apper to be grounds to force children internalise and comprehend everything they are being asked or talked to.

There are people who choose to have more money by reducing their vacant time, but some other people believe that it is more convenient to have more free time and not to earn that much money. These viewes are extremely controversial. 
On one hand, having not much of free time and getting a good salary is rather profitable and efficient. It has to be noted that people's life is pracrically impossible without such a source as money. People always need it and the fact that they will be working some extra hours never scares them, as it will bring additional profit to their families. The money they get can be later spent on food, clothes and much needed vacation, as the process of earning it may be stresfull and draining. 
On the other hand, enjoying more vacant time and having a lower salary has advantages. People who stick to this strategy spend more time with their families and friends, which gives them incentive and lets socialize without any problems. The ones who prefer this way of life maintain relationships successfully and never neglect much needed communication. Moreover, this schedule also helps to keep the workmen's health in a sustainable state and provides the possibility of further education during the working period. 
Summarising all of the ideas, I have highlight that both strategies have their pros and cons, each person is up to decide for himself or herself. I suppose that the second view is closer to me, as it gives much more opportunities and freedom to any person and it is not as exhausting and depressing. Both of the ideas are widespread nowadays and have many people supporting them.

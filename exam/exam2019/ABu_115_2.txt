In today's world, it is private companies rather than governments who pay for and carry out most scientific research. 
Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? 
Nowadays, private businesses donate and invest in scientific works more than the government does. While there are reasons to emphasize benefitial effect of this tendency, I strongly believe that it can damage people more than it can benefit. 
There are many upsides of private companies's support for scientists. To start with, businessmen are free to invest in whatever they want. While, the government tries to find out, with a help of a contest, which projects are the most valuable (usually it tacks much time) private companies can invest in researches they are interested in. As an illustration, many great projects, concerning space exploration, medical treatment and IT were realized because of the generousity of private companies. Moreover, private companies However, there can be some problemes with investments in science as well. First of all, private companies are limited in their resources. It can be examplyfied by a significant number of valuable scientific projects, which were dismissed due to lack of money. Futhermore, there is a possibility, that the company has a vested interest in the research. If a private company, which can profit from war, has enough money for a particular project, it can result in a damaging consequences for the whole world. 
In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages of private donations to scientific works. However, in my opinion, it is a slippery slope for many factors and government takes a risky path by accepting private support for the science.

It is generally believed that all children are reared by their family and all the behavior they perform. Opposed to that claim that kids are mostly nurtured by what they sees outside their home and by how they get along with peers. This essay will disscus both points of views. 
To begin with, some humankinds allege that family has immensely big impact on how a child grows. All the patterns and the outlook on life are taken by a baby from his family and he act alike his parents. According to the survey undertaken by The Guardian magazine, 70% of children performed more like their parents rather than their friends, which presents us that a family has abundant influence in their child's life. 
However, there are people of counter opinion, who suppose that peers and the life outside home have a bigger role in child's development. Having grown up from a toddle age, youngsters begin to socialise, therefore, become a human with his in personality that is mostly affected by his camrades at school. In 2016, 100 pupils from age 15-17 underwent a research, which provided us with the information of young people tending to change their mind on a certain case under the pressure of his friends. 
From my point of view, children are more prevalent to be influenced by their family. The first steps of becoming a social humankind take place in an earlier age in family. It is generally known that beloved children are more feasible to be successful in further life, whereas only 15% of kids who were treated violently grow up as a mentally healthy social unit. 
To summarize all the information given, there are two views that contradict each other. Some people believe that children are nurtured by their family, others allege that the contribution of peers to the development of a child is much more powerful. This essay, nevertheless, agrees on the fact that children start to socialise inside the family and are given all the behavioral patterns from their parents and siblings.

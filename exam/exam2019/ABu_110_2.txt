In the modern world not only the government but also businessmen has power to rule the particular country or the whole world. It is not a secret that the science is one of the most important sphere because the scientifis progress has a huge impact on our everyday life. There is an opinion that nowadays more business companies but not governments invest their money in the sphere of science. It could be very useful due to the following arguments. 
To begin with the most powerful governments use science for achieving their own goals but not for the purpose to create something new. One of the good example could be "The cold war" in the middle of the 20th century between the USA and the USSR, when governments competed with each other and used the science to create new weapon. In comparisson with it, private companies invest money only then, when it is not harmful for the humankind and will help people to overcome the most important nowadays problems. The most popular spheres are medicine, technology and finding the solutions of the enviromental problems. 
One more argument is that the power and the influence of government will diminish. Although there are a lot of competitive private companies the progress could increse drastically. It is caused by the fact that every company needs to do their best to achieve good results and become more popular among people and influencial on the world arena. 
To sum everything up, today there are more advantages than disadvantages when the private companies will carry out and invest their money into the science.

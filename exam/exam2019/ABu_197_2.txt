Our century is a century of earning money, but there are some people who think that they do not need to be rich and to have a lot of money, but they can have moree free time. Others do not think so, and they prefer to earn money instead of leisure time. In this essay I will give some explanation to both views and give my own opinion. 
It is necessary for some people to work hard and earn money now for their future, having less time for the rest. These people try to earn more money and save it, so when they will be older they can travel, eat everything or do nothing and do not think about their amount of money. For example, my grandparents woked the whole life without holidays and whe they became 50 years old they did not work, had a nig family, traveled a lot and were really happy about how they spent their lives. 
Free time can be more important than money for those who prefer to live without any problems in their heads. What I mean is that some people do not want to think about their future and they live in the present, like "here and now". They are likely to spent all their money on food, small trips and something like that. They feel freedom in themselves and have thoughts that they can do anything. For instance, someone can have a job where he/she needs to work 2 or 3 hours per day, so the next part of the day he/she can do their hobby or have time with friends, which can bring more happyness for them. 
In conclusion, I want to mention my own view on this theme. To my mind, It is extremely important to combine the amount of work hours and free time. Time for the rest should be in life because it makes the whole process of work easier, because you do not concentrate only on your work. Nowadays we have a wide range of job spheres and places for the rest, so we should spend our time logically, not regretting about something in the future.

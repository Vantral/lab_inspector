The graph below illustrates the usage of fossil fuel energy during a period of time from 1970 to 2015 in five different countries. The graph shows how the percantage of fossil fuel usage changed throughout the years. 
China's, along with India's percentages of fossil fuel energy have been on an overall upward trend, rising from 60 per cent in 1970 to just under 90 per cent in 2015 for China, and from 35 per cent to just under 75 per cent for India, in 1971 and 2015 respectively. 
While France and Sweden had large numbers in the past, they have been steadily declining. France had 90 per cent in 1970, but suffered a steep decline beginning in 1972, lasting up until 2015, leaving France with just under 50 per cent. Sweden followed a similar path, going from 80 per cent in 1970 to just under 30 per cent in 2015, following a dramatic decline. 
Overall, it can be said, that all five countries, with the exception of China and India, are have lowered their usage of fossil fuels through the decades.

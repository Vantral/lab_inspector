The given bar chart provides the information about the percentage of Canadian children who suffered from obesity over a period of 20 years (from 1985 to 2005), whereas the table contains data about their engagement into physical activity for the same period. 
Overall, initially the proportion of boys struggling with this condition was higher, but then the percentage of girls who were overweight surpassed the boy's fraction. Also, the percentage of children doing physical excercises grew for both the categories. 
In 1985 the portion of obese girls was 11 %, whereas for boys the percentage was a little bit higher (12). However, already in 1995 they demonstrated the same level (16 % both of boys and girls had excessive weight). Since that year the fraction of girls remained higher with the percent of 25 in 2005 (the corresponding per cent for boys was 22). 
In addition, as we may notice from the table the overall fraction of children doing regular physical activity increased for both the categories (from 51% to 77% and from 57% to 87% for girls and boys respectively).

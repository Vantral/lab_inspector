The role of private companies in modern science and research is unmeasurable, and whether it is beneficial or not is a rather controversial question. Some people consider the benefits of such a situation to outweigh its disadvantages, others do not. Hovewer, as both sides should be taken into account before making any judgement, they will be discussed in the essay below. 
On the one hand, the situation in which the majority of today's reasearch is funded by private companies is highly beneficial. First and foremost, as organisations deciding to sponsor a scientific project have a specific aim in doing that, they tend to invest important sums of money in it. For instance, a company specialising in automobiles may want to improve its technologies by hiring scientists who would undertake a thourough research specifically for this organisation. What is more, usually research funded by a private sector does not twist figures to meet the ends of anyone. This means that the majority of such findings are not biased and therefore more reliable. 
On the other hand, there also are possible threats in the research being sponsored by private companies. The pro-government lobby emphasise the unstability of such investments, as they vary on the companies' aims and needs. For example, there may be periods of insufficient fundings when a company does not need any scientific help in order to develop and strive. Therefore, consistent fundings and organisation of the research by governments can be deemed as a good alternative in this situation. 
Overall, although the issue of the reseach fundings is quite topical in these days, it should be balanced between the government and the private sector. With both sides of the matter being considered, it is clear that each of the party is equally crucial in the scientific process.

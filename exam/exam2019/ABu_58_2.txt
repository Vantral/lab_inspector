Nowadays peole can face with a lot of problems all around the world (labour, violation, harassment and other political and economical ones). These people really need help. It is believed that it is difficult for one particular country helps all people in the world and the government should pay more attention only to its own country. Personally, I do not agree with this statement and consider that every person must get help not matter in what country he is. 
First of all, I tend to believe that it is the government's task to make some measures to overcome this problem. For example, to create different national organisations which will provide help to people all over the word. The country will benefit from it as other peole will know that it is a hospitable country and they can feel safety. It can imrove the economy as if more peole move to this country, more benefits they have. 
Secondly, if the government ignores other countruies and does not hepl them at all, it can lead to different hostile conflicts and maybe even a war. In that case, there will be a lot of fatalities and casualties. I think that we shold not allow these problems to start. The government should seek for some ways to help people from other places to be sure that its country is not in a danger. 
To conclude, I believe that it is possible to help all the people in the world. You should only know stratagies how to do it. If the government can find them, people will live a normal life and will be sure that they can get help in any part of our world.

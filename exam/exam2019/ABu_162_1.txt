The tables present the information about men and women employed in three different fields in Indonesia and Australia in 2010. The information is given in percent. 
As can be seen from the tables, the sector that recruited both men and women was services. Services employees in Indonesia were 56% male and 49% female, whereas in Australia the number of women in services was 88% and 65% were men. As for the industry, the Australian companies were more likely to offer jobs to men rather then women. The percentage of male and female workers was 32% and 11% respectively. In Indonecia, however, the amount of women in agriculture was 43%, which was much higher than the number of men in the same position(29%). Finally, industry sphere in both countries recruited a rather small number of people and mostly favoured men as employees. The data showed that in Indonesia male workers constituted 15% of the overall amount and that men in Australia made up 32% of the industry sector. 
To sum up, employers in Australia and in Indonesia were prone to employ both men and women but some spheres favoured men more.

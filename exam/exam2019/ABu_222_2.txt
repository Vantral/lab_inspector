Nowadays, there is a notion that the family has the greater influence on children's lives than the outside world. At the same time, there is a statement which is contrary. 
Given that the family plays an immensely important role in a child's life, it is unsurprising that many children are influenced by their parents so much. The members of the family usually teach children how they should live, what is bad or good, etc. That is why, it is obvious that many children are some kind of "home-made" because the whole information that they know about the world, the environment and the very life has been given them by their parents and other relatives. 
However, some people cannot agree with rhis statement. Many of them consider that only the outside world may truly influence the process of growing-up and the ability to form kids' personality. To tell the truth, it can be true given that children always explore new things at school and in other places which has no connection with their life at home. 
As for me, the greater influencer of children's lives is the outside world. In my opinion, children visit so a lot of places where they meet many distinctive people. Besides, kids become a part of various communities where they interact with people and share some experiences. On "streets" children know a huge number of things, which they are unlikely to know at home from their parents. At home many things are hidden because the members of the family might think that they are dangerous for their kids. That is why, I think that the outside world is the best "Live teacher" ever. 
In conclusion, it must be said once again that there are two opinions about the most powerful influence on children's lives but it is essential to mention that no one will ever teach you how to live and behaive in different situations but the very experience.

Many people stand by the idea that since it is impossible to help every single person all over the world, each government should support only its own citizens. I completely disagree with such position, because I believe in a global community, where people take responsibility for each other despite their nationality. In order to prove my point of view, I will now present a couple of arguments and examples. 
First of all, giving a helping hand to foreign people in need, whether it's migrants or citizens of a struggling country, will also benefit humanity as a whole. In other words, if a developed country aids the developing one in establishing a better economical, political, or social conditions, the world economy will later on get a new strong player. 
Secondly, giving migrants or inhabitants of remote areas the opportunity to recieve a well-rounded education only increases the amount of great minds ready to solve contemporary issues and develop our world further. For example, if only a small amount of the money and resources spent on researching the cosmos and building the rocket ships would have been spent on educating more people all across the globe, we would now have maybe ten times more people competent to explore the distant glaxies. 
Last but not least, saving others is also a matter of morality. Governments should not just creat an invisible domes around themselves and ignore the cries of other people they see as aliens. 
To sum up, although there are many ways one could decide whether it is better for the countries to mind their own business or actually help each other, in my opinion, creating a global community, where everyone is connected is the only path humanity should take.

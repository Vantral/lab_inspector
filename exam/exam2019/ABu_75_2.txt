Walking in the city, have you ever paid attention to some biulding with sophisticated shape? Have you thought what were they built for and why the architect used this particular style? There is a widely common opinion that the way the building looks like does not matter and it just should make its function. Nevertheless, others are convinced that the masterpieces should not be lost and constructors need to think of the shape of the future building as well as of its function. 
In my point of view, the appearance of the biuldings is essential. First of all, if we stop creating sophisticated and unusual designs of the buildings, in a few years all the cities will be similar. The cities will be losing their cultural identities and it will not be so exiting to visit new cities of countries because they are all the same. 
SEcondly, I am sure that the variety of designs of different buildings can make them look brighter and rise people's mood. If people walk in the streets where all the houses are similar and dim their moods will also be ugly as well as the buildings. Prominent architecture always makes people feel better. 
Summarising all the mentioned above, I am still convinced that bright and variable cities are much better than similar ones. All the cultural heritage we have now is the history of prevous generations and it is so different in styles, so as well as they did, we should fill our culture with new works of art, not usual and sad houses.

The large sphere of our life is given to science. Anyway, the question of who pay for all this science work is really relevant, because, as we see, private companies do it more often than governments. Nevertheless, advantages of such a practice prevail due to many reasons, some of which will be discussed now. 
First of all, while paying themselves for any scientific investigations, local companies have more "freedom" during their work. The fact is, nobody say them what and how to reseach. As a result, scientists have rights to choose and vary methods of their working process. As a prime example the cosmos investigation of Ilon Mask's company can be considered. Its latest construction of a car suitable for cosmos conditions was payed really much attention. This extravagant deed can hardly be done by government. Yet, it was not only for fun, but for scientific purposes, too. 
Last but not the least, the next advantage concerns money needed for scienctific work. Unfortunately, even many developing countries lack an appropriate funding, that is why governments simply have not enough money fot it. In these very cases private companies, with the rich leader ahead, come to help. It does not mean that a work goes absolutely without a government participation, but a sponsorship plays such a crucial part here. In Russia, for example, leading gas companies (Lukoil, Gasprom) work not only on production of fuels, but they do various reseaches concerning our Earth surface. The point is, they cooperate with Russian government, too. 
To sum up, there is a plenty of benefits from private companies which somehow boost scientific work. I hope more work in coopperation between governmental structures and private companies will be seen in the future.

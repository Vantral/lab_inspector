Family plays a significant role in every individuals childhood. The vast majority of it they spend with family. Many different opinions exist, however there is a popular tendency among people to believe that kids are mostly impacted by their parents. 
A survey carried out by World Health Organization showed that children tend to copy the information they recieve, in other words, do what they saw previously and say what they heard. Consequently, it comes out that an example that a child has, his parents, grandparents or babysitter may have a substantial effect on his character and what type of person he will become. 
In most cases, children grew up in an adequate families are to become an accurate and intelligent young people due to the example they had. Parents can change childrens mindset by giving proper advice an suggestions. 
Usually they manipulate their kids and make choices for them, because they presume they know what is better for their child and it often works for the best. 
Nevertheless, some people believe that, children are better influenced by outside world. Friends, kindergarden or sometimes even TV has a considerable impact on kids. For instance, a neice of mine have learned a new language by watching cartoons, thats amazing. Moreover, friends may also be the ones who are able to change childrens behaviour wheather postively or negatively. 
To conclude, it is rather difficult to decide which point is more accurate and probably correct. In my opinion both points make sense and has a ring of the truth. However, I believe family has a bigger influence in children.

The pie charts compare the most widespread motivations for coming to the library among the UK citizens in 1990 and 2000. 
Overall, the number of visits themselves fell by almost a fifth. Borrowing and returning books was the main reason for library visits in 1990 and retained its status a decade later. However, looking at the least popular activities in the library, newspapers and magazines lost a large proportion of their readers. 
The quantity of visitors borrowing or returning books diminished from just under two-thirds of the overall number to around a half by 2000. At the same time, borrowing and returning DVDs was named by slightly less than a fifth of the overall number of visitors as their motivation, while studying was reduced to a tiny fraction of the overall reasons. Finally, while finding information only served as a reason for a tenth of the visitors in 1990, by 2000 that proportion doubled.

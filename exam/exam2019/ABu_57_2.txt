Some people think that government of certain country should support only those people, who are citizens of this country, because it is unreal to help everyone in the world. As for me, I disagree with this statement. 
The first reason, why I disagree is because I consider that all people should help other if they have that opportunity. We live in one world, so to my mind we should keep together and help each other. For example, a lot of countries have much more technologies and other advantages of living, than poorer ones. So, I think that these countries, in which life is better in all political, economical and social sides should help those countries, that are unable to solve problems themselves. Furthermore, then it will be a better balance in the world. These countries, that are not developed as much, as other, will take their support in money and also begin to develop, so the process of stabilisation of better life will increased. 
The second reason, why I disagree is because not every country could help their citizens, so there will be a great problem for people to live in this country. People will emigrate to other countries in which life is better and because of this, country, in which they lived, will lose a lot of work employers that gave them taxes. Exactly, by these taxes poor countries live. Moreover, the problem is that such country could even disappear if other developed countries would not help. 
To sum up, I would like to say that all people have different points of view, so it depends only on them. However, I consider that governments should do everything to solve problems in every country.

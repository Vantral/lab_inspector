Nowadays the importance of having a well-paid job and leading a luxurios life is on its peak. People often forget about real and non-material values that make a man happy such as family, friend or hobbies. In my eassay I would like to deliberate about setiting the priotities between gaining money and having spare time. 
First of all, Somitimes having free time may be worser than being occupied with work of any kind. A person always seeks for an occupation. On the one hand, it is possible to turn a hobby to a business and have fun while making money. On the other, setting up an enterprise or being a freelancer allows you having a flexible schedule which means that you can have enough spare time as well as money. For instance, today distance work is really popular, especially among mothers with little babies. By working through the Internet, women are able to look after their children as well as gain some money. 
However, it is not awlays like that. The circumstanes of contemporary soociety push people to earn more and more in order to enhance social status throug aquisition of various material things as car, apartments, etc. These people do not care about their free time, their desires makes them work hard. 
Differnet people have differnet values. I believe that we cannot compare these to categories of money and free time. of course, there is a saying "Time is money", but let everybody to deside on their own what to choose. I prsonally believe that nothing is able to make you happy, but you. You can be happy by spending free time with family or friends, or earning money during your lifespan.

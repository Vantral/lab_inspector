Modern people are always in rush because of their businesses such as hobby, family or especially work. Some people aspire to earn more money even if they sacrifice their free time, while others are against them. To my opinion, it is necessary to earn more money, because then your free time will become more useful and exiting. 
Those who are trying to be rolling in money understand that without hard work they will not obtain anything. That is why the prefer to have less free time, but for these people their leisure is more appreciated. They will not waste their time in vain. In advance people know what they should do and what they are eager to do. Moreover the sustain source of money can update the leisure opportunuties for a person, it can improve the content and quality of the free time. 
Hovewer, some people claim that they are ready to lose some potential money for the sake of their leisure time. It is obvious why people stick to this point of view. The person can hate his or her work, that is why it will not worth any efforts. Therefore, people are tend to find much time for leisure because they can spend it as they want. For example, a person can start self-development of enjoy the company of friends or his or her family. But i would like to mention that people who choose money have all these things and even more, that is why if your work is the source of stress it would be much better to find a new one, at least for the sake of your soul. 
To sum up, people share different opinions which depend on their needs and wishes. Although, it would be great if people could find the middle ground and find the balance between work and free time for thenselves.

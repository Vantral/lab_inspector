Could you imagine the situation where all people in the world recieve neccessary help? Or would it be more effective if governments help only their citizens? 
Some people are sure that it is possible to help all people around the world if everybody tries their best. Firstly, reech people could help homeless ones. For example, they could build shelters and buy them food. Secondly, such people think that helping others does not take much time, so it is possible. Besides, people believe in karma effect. If they do something good, it will come back to them, and everybody will be happy. 
However, there will always be people who consider the governments to be responsible for helping other people and for solving their problems. They think that only the presidents and royals of contries can invent the system which would privide help for people. Talking about the financial side of the problem, such system should include investing money in building new homes, food centres, schools and many more. Moreover, the governments should pay people more money, if they cannot find a propre jobs. From the social and spiritual sides, the royals should make special medical centres, where people will be tought to have a positive outlook on life and to cure all their diseases. 
I am sure that such system will work perfectly, if it will be well-organized. 
Taking into consideration all mentioned about, I stick to the point that it is possible to help everybody. The only thing that we need is good intention and financial support. And it is easier to male it through the government.

The bar chart and the table illustrate the percentage of children of both genders who had obesity from 1985 to 2005 and who regulary did exercises in 1990 and 2005. The most noticable part here is that the percentage of overweight girls and boys was increasing during the stated period of time, and at the same time, the portion of teenagers who did physical activities also underwent significant growth. 
In the cart we can see that in 1985 and 1990 the percentage of girls who were overweight was higher then the percentage of boys: 12%-11% and 14%-12% respectivly. In 1995 the proportion of girls and boys was the same (16%), but later the figures had changed. 
In the table percentage shows that the number of girls and boys who did exercise had changed almost similarly: for the girls it had increased on 26% (51%-77%) and for boys it is 30% (57%-87%).

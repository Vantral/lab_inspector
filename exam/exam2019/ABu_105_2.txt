Most of the scientific researches nowadays are supported by private companies and not by the governments. It is not clear whether it is a good tendency or not. This essey will deal with both positive and negative sides of the issue. 
Firstly, private companies are very enthusiastic, creative and they are encouraged to carry out surveys because it can help them to develop and, as a result, to improve their skills in some work fields. Many companies today carry out their own surveys, for instance, in economics, where the data are constantly changing. Moreover, they can easily find money and investors to provide researches and also they may negotiate with the specialists and scientist all over the world, which may significantlly contribute to collecting data so that it will make the research more valuable. 
Contrary to this, private companies have less authority to prove that their research is valid. Therefore, foreign companies may not trust to the scientific work which wasn't supported by the government of the country. For example, a survey conducted by a small private company might not get the scientific awards because it simply can't reach the level of popularity among their own country. Another thing is that government has more facilities and equipment for the precise and effective research. NASA is a great example of the unity of governments which contribute to the development of space exploration by using advanced technologies. 
All things considered, it is hard to say wheter scientific researches provided by private companies will succeed. I strongly believe that only a colloboration of government and public organisations can contibute to an effective, deep and valid scientific reserach.

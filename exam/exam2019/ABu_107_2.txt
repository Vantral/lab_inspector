Science is clearly something which is often discussed in today's world. A myriad of people advocate the view that private companies pay more attention to the scientific researchers. In my essay i would like to consider the advantages and disadvantages of this point. 
Let me start with the advantages. First of all, It is clear that government has a lot of tasks to do and it is obvious that it does not have time on scientific researchers. So, private companies can be a good solution to the problem. What is more, private companies are more follow their goals, they pay a special attention to science. A bright example of this can be our media, especially news. Every day they show how many breakthroughs in science people did in private companies. There is an abundant number of it that has been made during the last decades thanks to the private companies. 
Oh the other hand, opponents could possibly claim that the main goal of any political body should be developing science. It is our future and we should do everything to preserve ourselves as a civilized nation. Hovewer, if the government starts working in the sphere of science, it can lose main poins of the social problems with which people in country suffer from. In other words, government should focus more on the issues connected with our present. 
In conclusion, it should be noted that there are arguments in favour of this view and against. Overall, i am inclined to believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

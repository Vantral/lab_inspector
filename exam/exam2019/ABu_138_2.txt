In the modern world the question of sponsorship in science is widely discussed as in the prevalent number of cases it is sponsored by private businesses instead of government. Anyway, to my opinion, the cons of this case are definitely more considerable than pros. 
Firstly, private companies may be biased towards some discoveries and surveys. In other words, they may pay scientist more money in order to make them twist some numbers to suit the businessman's ends. A prime example of such actions is the wish to build an expensive housing estate in the area which is actually not allowed to be invaded due to its unique ecosystem. The main investor pays the ecologists and receives the permission to start the building process as the committee says that nothing will be endangered. If such a research is conducted by the government, there will not be such a result. 
The second point is that private companies leave some areas of research without attention. It means that businessmen are interested only in the development of the areas which bring them benefits and profit, while other parts of scientific world are left without any opportunity to develop to the lack of money. For instance, the branch of finding fossil fuels, metals and minerals is better developed than saving rare plants as the first issue brings millions of dollars and the second one is only about saving the diversity which actually companies do not care about. 
To summarize, the issue of private sponsorship in science should remain the issue of prime concern as it may cause bias and lack of development. The govenrments of all countries should pay more attention to providing scientists with money because it will help to keep the balance between consequent profit and safety.

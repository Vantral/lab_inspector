In the modern world many scientific breakthroughs are occured. More often some private companies instead of governments pay for many researches. Is such a sponsorship beneficial for the science? 
The main benefit is, that paying for the scientific researches, companies usually provide scientists with the sufficient amount of freedom, whereas governments always try to make scientists comply their will. What is more, more often big corporations have an opportunity to pay every equipment during the exploration, while governments have limited amount of money, that they can afford themself to spend for the science. Furthermore, the vast majority of scientist prefer to carry out researches in the private companies because the can earn much more money for theit breakthroughs and can use all the methods they want to. 
However, there are some disadvantages. For instance, some private companies can use restricted methods. In this case it is rather important for governments to control every scientific resesarch. What is more, some breakthroughs can be directed against governments. Some thing can be invented to overthrow the ruler or for many other revolusionistic aims. Furthermore, many companies are not aware of some political issues, so they don't care if their researches can hurt the interests of other contries. That is where even the real war between different states can start. 
All in all, it can be seen, that the quantity of advantages equal to the amount of disadvantages. Ofcourse, working for private companies means more money and more freedom in explorations, however, it can cause serious consequances for a state. It is rather important for governments not only control any researches even in private companies but also to provide scientists with more opportunities for their self-realisation.

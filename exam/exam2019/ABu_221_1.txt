The given charts outline and summarize the data towards a range of diverse courses in a UK college, following by students of different age. Generally speaking, it may be concluded from the charts that the students of younger age groups prefer more sports activities and science courses, while, at the same time, participants of older age group attend mostly arts courses. 
As it maybe seen from the pie chart, art courses have the most insignificant amount of students, which makes up in total 600 students, on the contrast to the other courses, which are followed by more than 630 students. Additionally, more than a half of 18-25 year olds are mostly interested in science(55%) and a bit higher than a quarter of participants are taking part in arts courses. On the contrary to the younger group, 40 years old and above students are not so interested in sports, approximately a quarter. At the same time elder students are more profound in arts, around a half of total amount of students. Moreover, it may be seen, that 18-25 year olds make up a small proportion, which consists just out of 15% of all participants of sports and health courses.

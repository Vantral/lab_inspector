Nowadays the problem of choice between money and time has become more popular. Some people cosider that it is better to earn more money and have less free time because they want a better life. Others believe that it is just a waiste of time and it is more essential to have more free time and live it for pleasure and have less money. In my opinion our life is not so long as we could see it and we need to spend it brightly and rightly may be without a great quantity of money. 
On the one hand, people should work well to rest well, and they can do it almost only thanks to their money. Moreover, in Russia there is one idiom telling that the person who does not work is the person who does not eat, and I suppose that it is true. For example, people usually want to travell but this enjoyment costs lots of money. So you should work a lot to earn enough money to visit any interesting place. 
On the other hand, it is much more necessary to spend our free time rightly and with a pleasure. Many famous people and celebrities do not have family and true friends or a sweetheart just becuse of their work. They have big cotteges, expensive clothes, gadgets, cars and opportunities to have a rest in really luxurious places but they do not have a people with whom they could share these pleasures. 
Overall, there are a lot of views and approaches to this topic that people can argument for ages, but it seems to me that having more free time is an opportunity to have more friends among in this grey world and a way to have more wealthy life than we could have with a heavy wallet.

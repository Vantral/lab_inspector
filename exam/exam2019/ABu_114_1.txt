The pie charts presented describe the percentage of libraries' visitors in the UK in 1990 and 2000. The main purpose of people coming remained both borrowing and returning books. 
From the charts it can be seen that visitors mostly used libraries to take books. These were 65% of people in 1990 and 10% less in 2000. However, reading of newspapers and magazines had reduced in three, from 15% to 5%. The number of people studying in such places had also decreased dramatically (10% in 1990 and 2% in 2000). What is more, finding information occupied not the least popular place in the list and contributed 10% in the end of 20th century and 20% 10 years later. The important thing to notice is that in 2000 there appeared a new part of the chart which was borrowing and returning DVDs. It can be explained by the fact that till this time DVDs have not been widely in use and, at first, did not exist at all.

In today's world, it is private companies rather than governments who pay for and carry out most scientific research. 
Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? 
Everyone knows that all things that we have now appeared thanks to the different researches which carried out scientiests. Obviously, is the fact that these studies should be paid by someone who can spend a lot of money. This essay will provide the advantages and disadvantages of the fact that private companies pay for and carry out most scientific research rather than governments. 
On the one hand, there are some advantages that private companies make scientific research. First of all, these private companies may have special interest to the topic of this research and on this way the study will be more evidence-based and correct. In addition to this, the private companies can choose one research and fund it fully. It leads to the the fact that this research will be more deep and will have more crucial impact on our life. 
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages that private companies carry out more researches than governments. Actually, the type of private company plays huge role in the research, because sometimes some private companies can have biased view on the research and it cannot be objective. That is why, it is very significant when the government pay for and carry out scientific research, because it demonstrates this unbiased ground of this research. 
To sum up, I would like to mention that it can be more effective when the private companies make variable scientific researches in the case if this research should be precise and also it can be more worthwhile if the governments carry out these researches because then they can be more objective. I personally think, that one disadvantage can outweigh the advantages because it is understandably that scientific researches require unbiased ground.

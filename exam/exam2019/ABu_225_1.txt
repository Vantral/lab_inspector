First and foremost, it is prominant to mention that there are three different dominant age groups in these courses(18-25 years olds in science, 40 and above in arts and 26-40 years old in sports and health). 
Besides, the amounts of adults (26-40 years old) from science and arts course are approximately equel (nearly a quater of all students attending the courses). Moreover, the total numder of students over 40 learning art is twice more than those who prefer sports and health courses. 
Futhermore, having compared these three charts, it is feasible to notice that three charts nave the same propotion of age, but with different age groups. 
Overall, the charts provide us with a profound insight on the propotion of three age groups attending the courses and main trends as dominant age groups and same propotion.

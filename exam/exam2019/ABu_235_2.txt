There is an argument among people who think that a family has the most important and biggest impact on children's development, while others are concerned that the life outdoors has a stronger influence. 
The first point of view is quite reasonable, because a child grows in a specific environment which was created by all the members of the family that bring him up. He learns out different traditions of his family, a specific way of thinking and expressing ideas and thoughts of his own. He is tought according to the specific model of child's development which was made and led throughout a big period of time. Family is a starting point for a child to explore himself and understand what to do with his life. 
Nevertheless, the second view also has a point. When a child goes outside the doors of his home, he explores the whole new world. He meets new people, potential friends, learn about different traits of characters. He attends school and learns loads of information about a range of spheres. School is an environment where a child creates all the relationships and try to build bonds with his peers, which is one of the most important expiriences. In addition, school gives us a lot of bad expirience, which is also helpful for a child's or a teenager's development as a person. 
In my point of view both family and the life outside a home influence us equally in the order we enter them. We learn a lot of things from both of the environments which give us priceless expiriences.

In this day and age, many people argue about whether the help of their governments towards other countries is justified. Personally, I support the point of view of those who think that it is better to at least try to help people around the globe rather than concentrate on the needs of your own country only. 
First of all, the capabilities of various countries differ greatly. For instance, developed countries have more opportunities and are more wealthy than developing ones. Therefore, the help from the authorities of developed countries to the people in the deprived areas of our planet is necessary in order to reach the equality at some point of our future history. 
What is more, helping others is a feature that differentiates humans from other living creatures. Moreover, it is praised in many religions and philosophical schools. Subsequently, it is a moral value that shows the ability of people to act human-like and is something valid to reach for. 
On the other hand, some people believe that the goal to help everyone is unachievable and, thus, should not be strived for. They also tend to consider only the help for close ones (meaning the citizens of their own country) significant as a huge amount of money that could be vital for solving local issues is spent annually to support other countries. 
To conclude all the mentioned above, there exist arguments for both points of view. However, in my opinion, it is crucial to keep in mind that we are humans and we need to help others if our governments can afford that.

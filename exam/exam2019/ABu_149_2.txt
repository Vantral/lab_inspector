-Some people prefer to earn more money and have less free time. Others prefer to have more free time and less money. - A lot of people cliam that hight salary is more important than have an extra time. Whilst, others choose having more extra time rather than make more money. This essay will discuss and provide arguments for both opinions. 
On the one hand, earning more money is a golden ticket to a good life. It means that when people who have enough money can afford family trips or a meet at the restaurant with friends. Therefore, they have no problem to spent their time with relatives and friends because money provides all this oportunities. According to the scientific research, people who have well-paid job, or high salary are more likely to have happy family and good relationship with their friends because of the amount of time they spend with them. 
On the other hand, free time helps avoid depression. It means that people who over-working are more likely to have depression and others mental disease. That is why, it is better to have around more positive environment, for example, watch some series, cook a favorite dish or read a nice book. Unfortunetly, there are thousands of fatalities due to problems at work, or debts which people are unable to pay because of a small salavery. For example, the notorious statistic in Japan, where every year thousands of people go in the window in the middle of work day. 
In my opinion, people should not be so addicted to their work. Nothing will happend if everything will has it turn. Hardworkers can make a scedule and manage thier time for some rest and spend a random evening with family, or drink in a bar with collegues. While, others simply can drink some vitamins or green tea, for them to be more relaxed and keep their mental health on a good level. 
In conclusion, both opinions have weight and have acuality for modern people. That is why, we shoud respect both sides but follow them partially.

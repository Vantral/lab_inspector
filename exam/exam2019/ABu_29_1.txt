The table shows as the percentage of boys and girls doing sports on a daily basis in 1990 and 2005 and the chart depicts the obesity rate among children in Canada from 1985 to 2005. It is clear that there is no real correlation between doing physical activity and being overweight. 
From the chart we find out that the number of children, who are overweight, has gradually risen since 1985. In 1985 and 1990 the number of girls suffering from obesity was a few points higher than the number of boys and was around 13 per cent. In 1995 the percentage was equal at 16. The further years show the change in the situation, because the number of overweigth boys gradually rose from 12 to 25 during the period from 1990 to 2005. In 2000 and 2005 the number of boys surpassed the number of girls. The table tells us that the percentage of children who did regular physical activity has increased from 1990 and 2005. The percentage of girls and boys doing sports does not differ much in 1990 as well as in 2005.

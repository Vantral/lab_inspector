It is more important for a building to serve its purpose than to look beautiful. Architects should not worry about producing buildings that are works of art. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree with these opinions? 
It is claimed that the beauty of the building is not as important as its purpose and there is no need for architects to worry about the physical appearance of theirs work. Nevertheless, some people still that the estethic view is important. In my opinion, the characteristics of the building are more important rather than its look. 
Firstly, the purpose of the building is more important as people should be in safe while they are inside the building which was created by the architets. The significance of the safety is better than its appearance. The quality of the building consists of the materials which were taken to build up this building. they should not be as cheap as they can in case it is a building were people are going to work, live or spent time. 
Secondly, the outside beauty may be the wrong marker of the quality of the building. There is a quote "All that glisters is not gold" which is strongly directed to the connection between the view and its purpose. People may move to a brilliant-looking house, but some tragedies may happen because if some unqualified materials or unprofessionals who did something not the way they had to. 
Still, people prefer to look at unforgettable and breathtaking "pictures" where might be nothing good inside. 
To take everything into consideration, the physical view of the building does not play the major role but the serving its purpose does. The personal safety, inside characteristics and the materials by which the building was made of matters.

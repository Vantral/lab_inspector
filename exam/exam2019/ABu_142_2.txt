Nowadays, many people wanted work hard and have big salaries, but they forget about relax. Others wanted to relax and have standart salary. I believe that those 2 factors should be balanced, and now I express why. 
On the one hand, it is normal that in our modern society people want to improve themselves, it takes a lot of time, it a hard work. But they do it in particular way to theis happy life, for some advantages of life, for example they want to have an opportunity to travel a lot, to eat tasty food, to buy new clothes, car or flat. There are many reasons for working hard. But there is onle one problem in that case. People forget to relax, which is so bad for their health. We always must remember about break, becouse that you can't buy exellent health. Moreover, people have less free time and forget that they have family, spent less time with wife or children. It ts the main reason for divorce. 
But on the another hand, you can have a good family, go with your children in park every weekend, help your wife in cleaning the flat and many other things. But have standart or small salary. In spite of it, maybe you can't give to your family this beautiful life, which everybody wanted. However, you will eat similar food or sit always at home, becouse you haven't any free money. It is too problem, that followed by a lot of scream and scandals. 
In my point of view, you should finf the frontes between work and free time. It must be balanced, becouse you can't sit and do nothing and wait when you have money. Of course you must go to work, but don't do some extra chore every day. 
In conclusion, we have a statement at the beginning of essay and two issues of it, and every person is ruler of his life, but I consider that you physically can't earn all the world's money, it is impossible. You try as you can. And it is no reason to decline you opportunity to have a rest. Fistly, you think about your health and secondly about money.

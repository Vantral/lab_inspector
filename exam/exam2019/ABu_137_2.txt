Nowadays the prevalent number of scientific research is sponsored by private companies rather than governments. However, some people say that there are more benefits of it then drowbacks. From my persperctive, the advantages of this practice outweight the disadvantage. 
To start with, private companies usually have much more resourses than the government of the particular country. That means, first of all, that funding of scientific researcher does not depend on current economic sutiation in the region and, what is more, helps to continue developing science when the government cannot afford to invest in it. Moreover, the country's bugdet is based on taxes that citizens pay and the govenment is responsible for the proper distribution of these money into all the spheres. Therefore, when private investors pay for scientific experements, in case of unseccessful investment politics could not be accused of the wrong use of public funds. 
However, some people assume that scientific research that are carried out by privite companies are biased because these companies have their personal money interst in proving and promoting some particulat points of view on any scientific questions. I strongly disagree with this opinion, due to the fact that privite companies are interested in long-term use of their products or service, but it is not possible when the scientific base of it is wrong. All in all, it is not beneficial for companies to twist the figures or sabotage the results of research, so we can assume that this drowback does not outweight the positive sides of such an approach. 
To sum up, there are more advantages than disadvantages of sponsoring scientific researches by private investors because the governments do not always haves an opportunity to afford it and they can be accused of not proper distribution of the money that citizens pay.

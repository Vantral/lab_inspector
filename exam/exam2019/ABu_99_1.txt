The line graph illustrates the persentage of energy from fossil fuels in China, United States, India, France and Sweden from 1970 untill 2015. Overall, there was a constant rise in the rates of China and India, while the United States, Frace and Sweden experienced a downward trand through all the period. 
According to the graph, the rate of France accounted 90% which was about 8% lower than the rate of Sweden. There was a slow descrease in both these rates in 1990 and then they experienced an upward trand untill the end of the period. In the meantime, the rate of China accounted 60% which was about 25% higher that the rate of India. Moreover, despite the fact that both rates had some flactuations, they increased steadily over the period. 
The rate of the United States was higher than 90%, which made up the highest contribution to the energy. In addition, there are no any flactuations, that is why the rate declined respectively in the end of the period.

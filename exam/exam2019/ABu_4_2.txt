"It is impossible to help all the people in the world, so governments should focus only on helping people in their own countries. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?"
Nowadays there are a lot of discussions around the topic of the help. Some people believe that the government should not help all of the countries, while others argue that the government should do everything for the peace in the world. In this essay will be shown both points of view and explained why the first one is more correct. 
To begin with, there are a large amount of areas that the government should work with. For example, medicine, edication, politics and so on, all of this should be improved in one country. If the government spend too much time, trying to help another places, it will not have enough time for its own one. Conseguently, the government should spend more time in the country where it works. What is more, the government should protect its own country from wars, it should support the connection with different countries, and the main thing on what it should concentrate is people. 
On the other hand, some people sure that everyone (and, especially, the government) should care of the whole world, if there is a problem in another country, they should do their best and help without any thoughts. Therefore, while there are some problems in the country, the government should try to deal with it. 
In conclusion, it is up to everyone to decide whether the help of the government to each country is essential or not, but in my opinion, the government should care about its own country, make some improvements, but still it the government should not close the country from another.

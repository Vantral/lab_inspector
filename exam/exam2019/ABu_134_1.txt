The bar charts illustrate the main reasons for visiting the UK public librariers in 1990 and 2000. Overall, it is clearly evident that borrowing and returning books account for the largest proportion of the total, while the shares of other ways of using libraries expirienced significant changes. 
According to the information provided by the graphs, the primary cause for library users to visit libraries remained the same throughout the period, namely loaning out and bringing borrowed books back. However, in 2000 this amount declined sharply by 10%, making up just over a half, when compared to the previous rate of 65%. Among other reasons that showed a decrease are visit for reading newspapers or magazines and studying, which constituted only 5% and 2% in 2000 respectively. 
In contrast, one fraction representing such reason as finding information increased. In 1990 it was only a tenth of the total use, whereas ten years later this indicator doubled. In addition, in 2000 a new category of reasons appeared, when visitors come to borrow and return DVDs. At the beginning of a new millenium this case accounted for approximately 20%.

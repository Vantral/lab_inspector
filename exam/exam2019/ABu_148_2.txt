In modern society one of the most important values that people tend to share is capability to work a lot and earn a big amount of money. There are doubts whether is it better to have more free time and less money or less leisure time but a higher income. 
From the one hand, earning a big amount of money is more attractive as it opens a lot of opportunities in organising vacations, buying valueble things and interacting with people from the relevant social group. The crucial point here is that person is able to satisfy his rising demands. For instance, bisunessmen take part in a global network consisting of people of the same status, while people from the middle-class cannot join them.

The key aspect here is that such group of people has a magnificent ability to lead their life without requiring a big amount of money. For example, they organise their trips using special web sites which allow to spend a little amount of money on planes, accomodation and food. They buy authentic things for decoration and design which makes their living more individual in comparison whith those who buy expensive pieces of furnitire that makes their houses look more vulglar. 
To conclude, mentality and mindsets of different people vary greatly, that is why they tend to act differently in their decisions and thoughts. From my point of view, there is always a compromise between saving free time and earning a lot of money, if a person is a freelancer, for example. All in all, everybody chooses his own way for development and values which he appreciates and shares whith others.

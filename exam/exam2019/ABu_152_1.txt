The tables illustrate the differences in employment by gender in various spheres such as agriculture, industry and services in Australia and Indonesia in 2010. The numbers are presented in percent. 
It has to be highlighted that the majority of service and industry workers in Indonesia were men, whilst there were more women who worked in the field of agriculture. Only 8 percent of the employees in industry were women. Likewise, only 49 percent of the working power in services accounted for females. However, the situation in Australia was completely different in some cases. Men working in services accounted for 65 percent, whilst women accounted for 88. There was only 1 percent of women that worked in agriculture and just 11 percent of females chose industry sector. As can be seen, the proportion of men and women working in industry was quite similar in both countries, whilst other variables varied. 
Considering the data given, it is clear that people in Indonesia and Australia had diverse opportunities to work, but the majority of males and females still worked in services in both countries.

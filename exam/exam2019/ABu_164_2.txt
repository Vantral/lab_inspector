Now we live in the era of modernization and techologies, that is why some people spend a great amount of their time at the offices and other workplaces to get more money and have more opportunities to live in this world, while the other people prefer to enjoy the life and not to be in constant pursuit of money. It is really controversial question which should be discussed in detail. 
First of all, why do people always want to be in charge and roll in money? In order to reach such a goal, people need to spend a major part of their life on working. Many people take it into account and as blind are trying to get benefit anywhere. All of us want to live without problems and have a lot of money. When you have money, you have more opportunities. It is possible to travel around the world, to buy a new car, to get the best education. If people are starving for that, they must work hard. 
On the other hand, some people consider this way of life is not suitable for them. The first reason is that people, who spend too much time on work, do not pay much attention to family and friends. In the modern world, where people are always in a hurry, it is crucial to remember about your closest people. Most people are inclined to think that our life is too short and we should enjoy every moment of it. Money for such people is not an ultimate goal but a means of happy life. They can live enjoying without a lot of money but with their closest people. 
In conclusion, while some people are working hard in dusty offices, other people are living their best life without much money. My personal opinion is that people should spend more time on themselfes and their families and friends. Actually, to have real friends is much more plaesant than a nice house on the coast of a sea.

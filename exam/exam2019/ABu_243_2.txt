The attitude to the most powerful influences in any child's life has been changing in recent years. Some people claim that the members of family have the most prominent impact on children, while others entirely believe that everything that happens outside the home is more important for any child. 
On the one hand, the family has a huge influence in child's life. First and foremost, our parents nurture us, show how to behave, how to cope with a huge problems in our life and how to build own family. For example, mother and father endeavour to show the perfect model of relationship in the family. Every day a child see how his parents communicate with each other and go through obstacles, how they tackle issues together. For this reason, the child analyze everything that happens in his family and in the future he will do the same and will try to build the same relationships in his own family. Besides, close people support the the youngster and give very useful advice when they do not know how to behave. 
On the other hand, things which happen outside have play a huge role in child's future life. For instance, all children study at school where they take knowledge in different spheres of life and after it they learn how to use it in real life. Moreover, they communicate with their peers and try to solve some issues with them alone, making some immensely prominent mistakes on which they learn. One more thing, which should be taken into the account, that they become more self-confident and independent, when they do not ask help from their parents or other members of the family. 
In conclusion, from my point of view, the child learns in all these two sides of his life and both of them influence him: his family and events outside the home. His close people support him, show the best model of behaviour and perfect family, whereas events from outside make him more independent and more brave person, who can solve any problems in his life.

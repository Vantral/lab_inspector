Nowadays, there is a tendency to spend all free time on job in order to earn more and more money. Nevertheless there are still some people who acknowledge their free time as the most significant source, despite of undoubtably crucial role of money. Thus, this esaay will discuss both these points of view to make this issue less complicated. 
The main argument that can support opinion of people, which are obsessed with their salaries is the fact that living in today's world cannot be feasible without money. Every aspect of social community, uncluding prestige, status, friends' respect and so on, is depend on the quantity of money. Moreover, almost every person cannot be satisfied only with food, water and living place. In otgher words, one of the factor that differs humans from animals is willing to have more than we need just for survivng. This wish for better, luxorious life results in working more and more. 
On the other hand, lifestyle of those, who prefer to have more free time and less money is quite understandable. Often, while trying to earn more than we actually need, loads of people forget their real aims. 
Besides that, due to the spending all the time for working, it becomes easy to lose immensely important parts of life. For example, person's family and friends could start to hold a grudge on his/her. 
By the way of conclusion it is important to point out the complexity of this controvercial issue. Though both of the view sides have their own reasonable arguments, I strongly belive that not salary makes our life better, but time, which can give us everything: friends, love and memories.

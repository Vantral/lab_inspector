The given chart and table demonstrate the number of obesity among girls and boys in Canada from 1958 to 2005 and the percentage of boys and girls who exercised regularly in 1990 and 2005, a period of 15 years. 
What catches the eyes mostly, is that the percentage of overweight girls and boys has increased, as well as the numbers of children who did regular physical activity in 2005. 
Equally, in 1985 the obesity rates were the lowest in comparsion to 2005, where the girls illustrate only 12 percent, while boys a little less - 11 percent. In contrast to this, above half of the children exercised regularly during 1990. 
Furthermore, in 1995 both girls and boys reached the same percentage of overweight - 16. What is more, boys overweight rised steadily among the whole period of time (1985 - 2005), but the numbers have soared in comparison to the girls overweight, whereas boys who did regular physical activity stayed dominant through these 15 years. 
Overall, there is a steady increase in both aspects - overweight and physical activity among boys and girls for some various reasons.

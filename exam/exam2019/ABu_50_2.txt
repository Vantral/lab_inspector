Nowadays in the time of the world integration and globalization there is the question - should countries help all the people in the world or governments should focus only on helping people in their own countries? Will it be more useful to spend all the budget to develop cities? Let us examine this problem more closely. 
I totally agree with the issue that the governmet should spend more money and pay attention exactly on development its own country. For example, Russian Federation. Nowadays our president try to hepl other countries such as Syria because in the future they can be useful for us (in the case of the war), but it would be better if the government focus on making cities flourish and sprawling like in European countries which have a capability to improve cities not taking part in international global problems. 
Secondly, a huge part of the federal budget comes to help citizens of our countries. Surely, all of the russian upset, because it would be beter if our tax system was focus on help russian people. In that way, we would have beter medicine, roads, houses and life at all. Now we do not almost have worth life out of the big megacities such as Moscow or Saint-Petersburg. 
But on the other side, if we will help other countries with money or army, they will help us it the future too. It may be what our president grasps and thinks of. Nowadays we try to connect with China because they have a huge influence on the trade. 
To sum up, it is crucial to say that firstly governmet of all countries should pay attention on their own citizens that voted for them and beter life.

It is believed that in our modern society the majority of all scintific researches is conducted by private companies, but not by the government itself. It is not possiple to overestimate the importance of such experiments, however the country's government should pay more attention towards the events in scientific sphere. This essay is devoted to the benefits and drawbacks of this situation. 
First of all, the authority of some private companies cannot be denied. Because of the financial support of their leaders, these foundations are provided with high-tech equipment and do not have problems with their emploees who are highly paid. Thus this situation affords to conduct any kind of scientific researches. Moreover, recieving some grants from their leaders teams of scientists can start some sophisticated researches in many spheres of science while it is not possible for some govenment's programmes because of the lack or a limit of money and tools. Furthermore, such private companies always aspire to new trends and tendencies, so they recruit young scientists with "new skills" and pave the way for their further development. 
Nevertheless, it is obvious that the products of private companies' are not always affordable for ordinary consumers. For instance, prices on some drugs can be higher. Moreover, it is also important to add that it is the right of the private company to share or not its own achievements in the sphere of science. In this way, the government cannot buy and use the results of such scientific researches to suit its own ends. Furthermore, there is a danger of selling this crucial information abroad. 
To conclude I would like to say that obviously there are some advantages and disadvantages of conducting scientific researches by private companies, but I recorn that the possibility to hold some sophisticated researches, giving work places for young scientist and further rapid development of science in the country outweight all the disadvantages.

The charts below depict the number of people of different age who visited a variety of diverse courses in a UK college in 2012. Overall, it is well seen that the most popular courses were related to science (650 students), and that arts courses were the least preferable for students as only 600 people chose them. 
Paying attention on the data gathered, it is possible to state that the young generation (18-25 years old) were into science more than in any other courses (55%), whilst only 30% of the group of 26-40 years old had the same preference. Nevertheless, the group of 26-40 turned out to be the biggest lovers of sports and health since 62% were attending such courses. As for the people starting from 40 years and above, this is interesting to highlight that the percentage of those who went to art courses was bigger than "science" and "sports and health" counted together.

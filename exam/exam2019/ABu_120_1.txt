The given pie charts illustrate the major reasons why the residents of the Great Britain visited libraries over the ten year's period. Overall, in 1990 and 2000 both, borrowing and returning books was the most common reason to visit such places in the country. 
Specifically, in 1990 the percentage of library visits with the aim of borrowing or returning books constituted just under two third of the total. Going to libraries in order to study or research was equally important to the inhabitants of the UK, with each of the two reasons accounting for a tenth of the whole number of visits. 
In contrast, the percentage of the books' borrowings and returns in British libraries dropped significantly in 2000. Visits with the aim of finding information doubled, whereas going to libraries for studying became much less popular among the UK residents with just 2% of the total. Another figure appeared to be of importance in the statistics of this year: visits of the libraries in order to read not books but newspapers and magasines constituted just about a fifth of the whole number.

Overall, the main trend is that both the number of overweight children and the number of boys and girls who did regular physical activity increased significantly by 2005. 
Firstly, let's turn to the table. According to the data, from 1985 to 1990 there were more girls who suffered from obesity, than boys, by 1990 it was 14 and 12 per cent relatively. In 1995 the amount of overweight children bocame equal and was 16 per cent. By 2005 there was a dramatical growth of overweight children and the amount of boys became bigger than the number of girls (25 and 22 relatively). 
Secondly, let's move on to the table. The figures compare boys and girls, who did regular physical activities and we can clearly see that the number of boys was bigger than girls in both 1990 and 2005. But it also demonstrates that the whole amount of children, who practiced different kinds of sport, increased by 2005.

Two given pie charts represent the data about the purposes of visiting libraries in Great Britain in the last decade of the 20th century. The consistance of the diagrams slightly changed but they still have the common tendancy. 
According to the chart of 1990 the major reason of visiting of public libraries was borrowing (65%). This trend was excisting and leading all 10 years, as the result the second chart shows the leading role of the same aim (55%), it slightly dropped by 10%. The fact of dramatic decrease of the quantity of visitors who read newspapers and study in the library can't be neglected. From 10% of studying people it falls to 2%, the difference is in 5 times lower if we compare these two periods. The same picture is illustrated by the statisctics of readers og mewpaper and magazines: from 15% to 5%, the tripled decrease might be noticed here. 
The striking fact of appearing of a new category of visiting reason is presented by the second pie chart. Despite the fact of inceasing number of persons who find information in books we should draw our attention to the process of borrowing and returning DVD's, which has been taken about the 5th part of the whole diagram by the beggining of the 20th century.

In the modern world, there is an opinion that private companies pay for and carry out most scientific research rather than the government. They are considered to be more engaged in the sphere of research, while the government has a smaller impact on the scientific development and gives it less support. 
On the one hand, the main advantage of this fact is that the commercial companies do not only get big amounts of money, but also donate it for the further development which can be connected with these very companies or with the whole world in general. We always can see the progress, no matter who attempts to it. As long as the companies pay for scientific research, the government has bigger opportunities to develop the social sphere of life, to support poor people, to establish new public services. 
On the other hand, there is a risk of dedicating all the research only to the interest of concrete companies. In this case there cannot be any scientific breakthroughs in the modern world. One more problem is that there should always be a state program of development in different scientific spheres. And if there isn't any, there cannot be any direction of development, if companies carry out different research in their own ways. 
Taking everything into account, we can notice now that the advantages of the described trend outweigh the disadvantages. The right distribution of financial and other responsibilities in every state can lead to the sustainable development and harmony, especially if the directions of the development are clear.

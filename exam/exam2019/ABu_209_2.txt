Nowadays a lot of people think about money and discuss with others about money. However, is it important to earn more money and have less time? Some people believe that have more free time and less money is it normal. Others prefer to earn more money and have less free time. I suggest that money are very important in our life, of course, we spend a lot of time to earn money, and we have not got free time to spend them. 
On the one hand, people believe that with money they have more opportunities in real life. For instance, if you have money you can travel around the world and explore different culture and history. Moreover, with money you have not got economic difficulties, whatever you what you can buy. However, if you earn money, you have less free time. Statistics show that more than 11 months of 12, people who earn real money have spend on work. It means that they have not got time to their family, friends, their interests and hobbies. 
On the other hand, some people think that have more free time and less money is much better. First of all, time is one of the main thing that people cannot buy. Next, with free time you have more apportunities to find interests and work that you realy like. However, without money you cannot have all what you want. Money is important in our life. 
To sum up, there are a lot of discussion about this topic. I think that it is more important to have free time and have work that earned money, and work that you realy like and enjoy.

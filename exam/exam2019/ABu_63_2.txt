Globalization unites many countries all around the globe and makes it easier to communicate and find solutions for different problens. However, there is an opinion that people cannot help all those who require salvage or any kind of assistance, so countries need to solve internal problems only. This essay provides an opinion on why governments should try to help eveyone in the world. 
Firstly, if a country helps other state or government, it might get assistance when this country also has difficulties. For instance, many EU countriens call for financial support, receive money, and then help with something else if needed. In this case people can evict any possibility to face global crisis. This type of help is widely-practiced and and supports the opinion of helping people globally. 
Secondly, global commutity has many spots where urgent issues exist and develop. These problems cannot be assigned to one country only and need to be fought by many governments. For example, a lot of of african countries suffer from food crises which is developed due to economic sanctions implied by european states. Therefore, many people face lack of food, the governments have low budgets to supply theris residents and are unable to have everything needed. The staded issue is too perplexed and cannot be overcame by one country. This is why other states must be open and help those who ask for help. 
To sum up, people ought to try to make it possible to help all the people in the world. I prefer to assume that only this way of thinking can lead to a full spectrum of issue undergoing and, therefore, improve everyone's living.

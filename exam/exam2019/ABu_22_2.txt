In this day and age we face a lot of serious problems: poverty, world hunger, etc. Some people think that helping people all over the world is a waste of time and that governments need to focus on tackling the problems existing in their own countries. Personally, I believe that in order for us to enjoy life we need to help each other as much as we can. In this essay I will give arguments to support my point of view. 
First of all, in our world relationships between countries are important and might be beneficial in the future. So when we are helping people in difficult situations, for example sending food and water when needed, or welcoming refugees from countries in war time, we develop a bond with them. Later in life we might need them to lend us a hand, which is actually very useful. Secondly, governments should motivate major companies and rich individuals to make significant changes in many worldwide issues: if a person with a big amount of money would give it to poor people with no homes, we could easily reduce the rates of homeless people around the world. 
Moreover, if we put aside all the benefits for the country, it is in human nature to help others. When people ignore someone's cry for help it is inhumane. In addition, it feels good to be able to do at least something when people are faced with serious problems. 
In conclusion, it is a long way down the road. We sure cannot help everyone, yet even one action could make a little change. It is about people caring about one another, it is about being a human. Goverments should definitely help each other, and encourage people to do the same.

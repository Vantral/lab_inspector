There are different ways to live this life: to create a family, to develop your business or just to enjoy every day. I think people should work hard for the best future, but also they should not forget about the rest. 
Some people like to spend all their time by working. Firstly, they work for rich lives of their families. They can travel a lot, eat healthy or exotic food, wear expensive clothes and others. Secondly, the workers cannot live without their work and business, because it is the aim of all their lives. But usually they forget to spend time with their relatives and to make them happy by their own existance. 
In the other hand, other people support the idea to have more free time, but usually they have money to buy only vital things. However, this type of people have time to read interesting books, watch the great diversity of films, find themselves in the different spheres of working and others. They try to spend more time with the family. Moreover, the people of this lifestyle cannot live in expensive houses and buy stunning clothes. They have enough free time to travel the world and develop their knowledges, but there is no money for it: they still should pay the taxes and buy food for surviving. 
In conclusion, I suppose that we can follow the average position: people should work and earn money, but they should not forget about their loving families and they can rest with the relatieves on the weekends.

Nowadays a big amount of people want to earn more money and have not so much free time. Other people want to have a lot of free time and not so much money. My opinion is that it is more convinient to earn not so much money and to have a lot of free time. 
Talking about free time it should be mentionted that if people have lot's of it, they can do something interesting and useful for them. Firstly, people can have a hobby or even some hobbies that is very important in our life. For example, if I have free time I go to the voleyball classes and develope my body and my skills in this game. Moreover, I have another hobby - reading, it helps me to relax and to forget about my routine: study and work. It means that without hobbies it is hard to work every day and to do the same things there. Secondly, a big majority of people has a child and parents should educate them and take care of them, and if people try to earn more money - they will not have enough time even for walking with their children and they will communicate more with their friends and relatives, rather than their own parents. It is one of the most common mistake in our modern world. People understand it too late that they had not given so much attention to their children. 
Some people consider that financial component is the most significant aspect in our life and we should do everything to earn more money. Their view is based on the fact that nowadays it is hard to do something without money, even if you want to spend your free time, for example to go shopping or to go on some classes - you need money. 
To sum up, I would like to say that there are a lot of different views connected with this theme. However, I think that we should pay more attention to our free time.

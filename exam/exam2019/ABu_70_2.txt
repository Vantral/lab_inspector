Lately there is a lot of discussion on the topic of intertational political maintainance and help. Due to that some people claim that countries and governments should only take care of their own citizents as it is quite problematic to help everyone. I personally disagree with that statement and believe that governments should provide help for all the nations globally. 
The first and the main reason why I tend to think this way is because lots of political issues that can be seen as local problems these days are actually cases of international concern. To put it in other words some issues cannot be solved just by one nation or country. A good example of this is the war in Syria, up to this day the government of the country still needs lots of funds / medical help and other financial support from developed countries to resist the attack of the opponent in case to provide better standart of living for the victoms. 
The other reason why countries should be concerned about all the nations equally because in this way governments tend to improve their political relations. This alongside leads to more international deals, opens up fair trade between countries, paves the way for more scientific and medical discoveries as the scienties are to share their studies more and to provide more open access. For instance, countries that are in a close relationships like USA and Canada are more likely to provide mutual help or maintainance for the citizens of each other than for the countries of the asian world. 
Taking everything into the account, it is more benefical for all the governments to provide help for all the people around the world so that both governmrnts and citizens would benefit of this way of policy.

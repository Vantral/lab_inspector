There is an opinion, that there is no real relevance in making the appearance of buildings better, what is more importaint for architecture is to serve it's purposes. I would prefere to partly agree with this statement. 
Firstly, I would like to say, that buildings from the times, when humans learned how to make them became one of the most significant parts of our life and continues to be by now. And, of course, firstly they were maid only to surve its main function- to help us survive, give us shelture. But that was long time ago. People accuared new knowlages and now our live became much easier. We don't have to hide from our natural enemies and have an ability to make the life more pleasand. That's why people started to develop architecture-something, that is always around us and depending on our surroundings even our well-being can change. To my mind, now for a building just to serve it's basic functions is just not enough. Of course we should pay attention on that mostly but now we are able to do more than that with our technologies. Maybe humankind can afferd now to make it's life more pleasand. 
What is more, a developed architecture now became a sign of a country's sustainability and prosperity. For example, scientists can learn about acient tribes and civilizations by their buildings. That can be reflected to our times. We transfere our daily life on our homes and working plaices. That will help us leave something for the next genetations, something for them to learn our history and thier roots. 
In conclusion I would like to agree, that designers should pay a lot of attention fow their works to serve their basic functions, but we shouldn't forget the real relevance of beauty for us, and how much we can achieve now not by just building white walls, but making a masterpiece of the whole nation.

The information illustrated in these two tables indicates the proportion of men and women working in three various fields in two diverse countries as Indonesia and Australia in 2010. Overall, the most striking feature of the data is that in both countries people of both genders are prone to work more in the sphere of services than in two other ones. 
To look in more detail at the figures, agricultural sector is significantly prevalent in Indonesia than in Australia. Besides, in Indonesia there are much more female representatives in this field than the male ones (43% and 29 % respectively). Nevertheless, the different situation can be pointed out in Australia since there are more men in the agriculture than women (3% and 1% respectively). Furthermore, turning to the industrial sector, Australian people tend more to have a job in this field than Indonesian workers. To be more precise, there are approximately twice as many male people in the industry in Australia as in Indonesia, accounting for 32% and 15% respectively. Although there is not a sharp difference between the percentage of women working in the industry in two distinct countries, the tables provide the information that there are slightly more female workers in the industrial sector in Australia than in Indonesia (11% and 8% respectively).

These two tables below illustrate Indonasian and Australian three employment sectors in 2010, showing both men and women. 
Overall, providing data on the empoyment by gender, it is quite obvious to emphasize that all the female workers in both countries work more in Services and Agriculture (exept Australian women here), while the male workers prefere to work in the Industry sphere. 
Considering the fact, that Indonasian female specialists give their priorities to Agriculture (43) and Servicies (49), here might be figured out the thing that Australian women are more into Services (88) and less into Agriculture (1), comparing them with female workers from Indonesia. In Austalia only one female worker preferes the job, connected with Agriculture, while in Indonesia there are almost 43 women who are interested in it. Industry in both countries is not that popular, for istance, in Indonasia only 8 women would like to work there, nearly the same situation is seen in Austaralia 11 women. 
Talking about male workers it is also clear that in neighter Australian (3) men nor Indonesia (29) prefere Agriculture as their job. They varies in 26 men. What is more, the most popular area of employment was the spheare of services. The highest rates were directly there 56 and 65 men. They both have a tiny difference. Considering the Industry, it is worth saying that in Australia more male workers prefere to work there, than in Indonesia, they differ appriximately in 17 persons.

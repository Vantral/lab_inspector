Nowadays there are a lot of different views on the issue connected with earning money. Some people choose to spend more time working and making money, while others want to spend more time doing other activities and they do not think that it is salient to spend their life on earning money. 52 On the one hand, money play a role of a paramount importance in our lives. People without money cannot live successfuly, they always feel themselves greedy and want to make their lives better. So, people choose to spend less time on their leasure time and prefer to work harder and longer because they need to earn more money for their happy life. They need to give a good education for their children, travel far away in a place of their dreams, buy a car and clothes of high quality and so on. 
On the other hand, some people do not really need a lot of money. They find hapiness in simple things. They like to walk and spend more time with their children or friends, they want to be independent from money and salaries, they do not think that they need to spend all of their time on earning money, because they want just to live and relax do not thinking too much about it. 
In my opinion, it is hard to live without money in our modern world. Everything and everywhere you will need them. There is nothing free and you need to pay for every thing which you want to have. All of the doors are open for people who like to work and who have a lot of money. That is why I reckon, that earning money is better than having a lot of free time.

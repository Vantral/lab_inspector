These two tables show the information about the distribution of women and men working in three different sectors in Indonesia and Australia during the period of 2010. The main striking feature is that in both countries the biggest amount of workers are busy in the sphere of services. 
According to the first table there is more female workers in agricultural sector, the difference is more than 10 people. While in Australia more men are busy in this sphere. The same tendency in distribution of workers is connected with industry. In both tables the data shows that there are more men than women in industrial sector, almost twice in Indonesia and almost three times in Australia. In both countries the sector of services includes the biggest number of working people, but the tendency differs. In Australia the amount of female workers outweight the figures of male workers, while in Indonesia services is more preferable for men rather than women.

In our modern world huge amount of breakthroughs is condacted mainly by the private oranizations withought any government support. Many people claim that this approach has a positive effect on scientific reasearch while others disagree with them. This essay will illustrate several advantages of non-government support into scientific sphere. 
Firstly, fungings from the government is not always a beneficial idea because the government often cannot supply the scientists on time that lead to stop of the researchers' work. For instance, a central lab in the UK that works with machine technologies cannot continue to develop new inventions because the government plays a role in over spheres of the life and does not always have time for small projects that may have a great role in the county's future development. 
Secondly, the amount of private companies continue to spread among the globe because there are no strict standards of what to do and when to do research while those projects that are condacted with the government's help are often stop the process of developing new products even though work conditions are high. For instance, SKOLKOVO lab in Moscow that is sponsored by the government and has a privilage number of all the newest instuments for research does not correspond with expectations that were made by the authorities. Many researchers say that the results are not inspiring because there is a bunch of strict deadlines and unability to relax which is undoubtedly a cause for unsatisficated results. 
To conclude, it is crusial to mention that withought new inventions and competence of scientiscts the development of humanity is about to stop that is why the right way to sponsoring scientific research should be found. Nowadays, new breakthroughs are less hard to achieve by the payment from private companies.

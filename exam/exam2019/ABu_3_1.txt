The visuals demonstrate both the data on the fractions of overweight boys and girls over the span of the years from 1985 to 2005 and the information on the gender ratio among children who are physically active in the period from 1990 to 2005. 
According to the bar chart, although more girls than boys were reported to be overweight in the beginning of the time span given, this situation reverses in the following years. For instance, the percentages of the overweight boys and girls are equal in the year 1995 and by 2005 one fourth of the males were overweight in comparison to only 22% of those among the females. The table that provides data on the approximately same time limit illustrates the fact that although both genders demonstrate a substantial increase in the fraction of physically active ones, boys remain predominant. For example, in the year 1990 57% of boys were persuing an active lifestyle, while the fraction among girls was only 51 percent. A similar situation is to be observed in the year 2005, when 87% of males were active in comparison to only 77% among the females. That way, the boys of the 21 century are more physically active than girls are, nevertheless, they demonstrate higher overweight rates.

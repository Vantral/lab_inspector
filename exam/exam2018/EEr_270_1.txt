The graph illustrates the distribution of fossil fuels energy used from 1970 to 2015 in different countries such as China, USA, India, France and Sweden. Accourding to the graph, we can see how the percentage of energy from fossil fuels was changing in these countries in their different way during this period of time. 
Back to time between 1970 and 1980 it was highly widespread to use fossil fuel energy among all five counries: the data fluctutes in all the counrtries from more than 90% (USA) to 60% (China), with the exception of India, which has a lowest figure of 35% this energy used. 
From 1980 to 2015 the percent of energy from fossil fuels in such countries as France and Sweden was dramatically dropping (in 2015 the figures are less than 50% and less than 30% respectively), whereas in India (in 2015 slightly more than 70%) and China there was a rise, and China in the year of 2015 was the country that use energy from fossil fuels more than other counries with just under 90%. In USA there was a slow downward trend during this period. 
Overall, we can sum up that by 2015 all five countries, except for China, tend to decrese thier use of energy from fossil fuels.

Nowadays there are a lot of people who strongly believe that an old building should be more usful as beautiful. Others people agree that it is necessary to create a building just care not about usful places and also about an art view looks like. 
One one hand, all people want to be save by dangeory situations, that is why architects should be careful with their work and try to do the best for creating new building which would be serve for their purpose. Moreover, if people do not care about beauty of buildings it is easer to create modern, practise offices and houses for a big amount of people. 
On the other hand, people should not forget about historical ahievements. There are a lot of amazing and beautiful buildings in the world which were built by famous architects. This kind of buildings should be in the Earth anyway. Futhermore, people cannot forget and let the history to go to the past. 
In my perspective, it is necessary to connect as serve of buildings as its beauty. Because of this amazing architecture, people can go to any part of the world and have a pleasure to see famous creating which were built, for instance, 1000 years ago. 
Taking both sides of the arguement into consideration, it is clear to notice that architects have a possibility to create only modern usful building, but if we want to see the beauty of the world which could be created by people, we should try to combine both this subjects in one creating.

The diagram below illustrates the amount of energy generated by fossil fuels in five various nations. 
From the graph we can see the data about China, United States,India, France and Sweden. To start with, the line that indicates the United States shows the highest percentage of enegry produced by fossil fuels. It reached more than 90 per cent in 1970 and stopped being a leader only in 2005 with approximately 84 per cent. 
As far as Chinise energy line, it reached its peak in 2010. China and India had the same positive tendency. The indicator of fossil fuels energy in India constantly increased from about 35 to 75 per cent and the one in China rised from 60 to 87 per cent respectively. 
Regardinf Sweden and France, both of them had bad tendencies. Their energy generally plummeted in the period between 1975 and 1990 (they had around 80 and 90 per cent in 1975 and about 47 and 27 in 2015). 
Overall, it is obvious that among 5 different countries between 1970 and 2015 the Untied States lost theit leadership as China began to produce more energy with fossil fuels, whereas there was less Indian energy and Sweden became the least productive country of fossil fuels energy.

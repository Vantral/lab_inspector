Nowadays, we have buildings of all shapes and colors, whatever their actual purpose is. Still lots of people think that we should not pay so much attention to what the building looks like but be more concerned on the reason it for what case was built. 
I disagree with this opinion. Firstly, most buildings cannot look same just because of their purpose. You cannot observe stars in small squared house or cannot paint in a building with lack of the sun light because windows are too small. For these reasons we cannot have buildings with the same shape. Secondly, if all hoses would have same shape and color we would have a problem with orientation and finding right direction. It is common to explaine the way using something like "turn left near blue house and go straight". If all houses looks similar a person without a map will be lost really soon. 
However, some people think that buildings should not look beautiful and architects should not try to produce a work of art. When a beautiful building is built people of course impressed, but then years later the building starts to become ruines. Imagine any theater or museum building with all the mosaics and statues on its roof. Organizations inside such buildings have to redecorate them every couple of years and materials are not so cheap so ticet prices become higher to cover the redecoration works and people do not want to pay more. 
In my point of view, going somewhere like a theater is a special event. Now we often have ordinary and same-looking houses and beautiful and outstanding museums. When museum looks like an ordinary place to live emotional part of trip would be runed or at least minimised in half. 
In conclusion, I want to say that looking beautiful is part of the building purpose. Architectors exist to make a building unique, not to make it one of the mass of similar.

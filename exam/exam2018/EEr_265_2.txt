It is generally believed that architects must make a project of beautiful, breathtaking buildings. But now people start realize that it is not so crucial, also they assume that we build house for certain aims. I tend to think that buildings should look perfectly and be with some art features. 
Buildings are everywhere and we feel satisfaction, if we see an amazing house or strange scyscrapes. Architects must produce interesting buildings which will take our attention and show our life. What I mean here, is that create modern and beautiful house is vitaly important for saving our culture. The great example of it is Moscow centre's buildings. When we walk in centre we can easily understand previous culture by looking at oldfashion houses. By the way, we must build new houses acording to our modern culture for our next generations. 
Another special consideration is that beautiful buildings can take people's attention. If in the city a lot of breathtaking buildings, a lot of people will want to see it and visit. Aethtethic and famous places can be interesting for tourists, also, nobody wants to visit boring, grey city. For example, many people want to take a picture of 5 popular Moscow city buildings. They are made from glass and look really outstanding. There is no denying that a lot of tourists come to Russia to visit it. 
In conclusion, i would like to say that it is crucial to build houses not just for their main purpose, but for aethtethic pleasure.

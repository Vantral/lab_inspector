On the graph below, we can see the percentage difference in income between men and women. This graph shows us the comparison between the numbers in five different countries from 1980 to 1995. 
As we can see, the peak of difference in Japan was in 1985, while in other four countries the greatest percentage numbers were in 1980. As the time went by, the differences in almost all countries were becoming less and less but Germany is the only country to have increasing number after 1990. 
The numbers of Japan, UK and USA were quite similar, and results of Germany and New Zealand were much lower than other countries' ones. However, the ranking of differences almost did not have any changes from 1980. The only thing that changed is the fact that USA and UK replaced each other, USA became the third one instead of the second one, and vice versa for UK. 
It is clear that percentage numbers became much lower in all five countries, but the difference between some of these countries was still big enough.

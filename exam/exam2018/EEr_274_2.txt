Parents always argue about how to raise their children and thereby they influence them with their own opinions. As it is believed childen should be influenced more by their family, but the outside world has its also very important role in becoming a person. I think, if people could find a balance in it, then both children and parents will be happy. 
There are several great advantages of family's influence on child. On the one hand, i strongly belive that family relationship built child's character and behaviour more than anything else. For example, when you go for a walk, you always see people with different reactions on the same situations. It only depends on your personal qualities, which are brought to you by your family members. On the other hand, the outside world has even more pluses for child's identity. Firstly, child gets his own taste in whatever he wants. Of course, if affects his personality but that is how the real world works. People, who spend time in their childhood both: inside with a family and outside with friends are more likely become successful in an adult life, than childen, who had never seen a real world by their early 18-th. 
However, there are some disadvantages in each type of influence. First of all, childen can start a friendship with a bad company. It can leed to drug and alcohol addictions. As for me, i had a friend who was spending his leisure time outside and then become very aggressive. Moreover, there is a big problem with over-carring a child. Not giving a children pocket money can lead to a robbery and irresponsibility for their actions. 
In conclusion, i would like to say that parents should find a balance in how to raise and influence their children. Both influences could give a non-strong mind of a child his own view on the world which will help him in a groun-up life.

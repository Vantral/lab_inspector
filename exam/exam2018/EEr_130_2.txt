Nowadays, it is believed that people demand much more in architects in designing new buildings. Equipped with modern technologies and redundancy of resources, there is a general expectation for new constructions to be not only safe, accessible and practical but also pleasing to the eye. Some people think that is is unnecessary for building to be attractive but uther cannot agree with them. In this essay i am going to discuss this topic. 
A building is not only standing for a short time. Some may exist much longer that their expected usage time, like the Pyramid, ancient temples and churches. We want people to treat the buildings with respect and grace. People can find pride, effort and inspiring stories from the buildings. Every building is unique and has its own personality like a person. We found heroism in the Chinese Great Wall; We found strong religious sense in the building of St. Peter SquareÂ’s; and We found beautiful scientific patterns in the Golden Gate Bridge. People like to enjoy the practical use and architect design of a building. 
However, it is undisputable that a building should meets to fit the purpose of the building first. For instance, a hospital must be suitable for the medical use; a university should be convenient to students and professionals; a factory should be convenient to the production line and the transportation. Of course, a building must first meets its purposes but they should also meets with the design. There is no contradiction in the two areas. For example, the Sydney Opera House is a famous landmark in the world as well as a functional opera house for the local residents. 
In conclusion, a building should be built to serve its purpose first. But the architect should also design the building with good artistic sense to finalize it as a work of art

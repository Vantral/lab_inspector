From these two tables we may see the percentage of wokers of different genders in three employment sectors in two countries: Indonesia and Australia. As we may notice, the quantity of male wokerks in industry sector both in Indonesia and Australia is greater than female ones. Nevetheless, in the services sector tables show us that, for instance, in Australia more women tend to work in it. At the same time, only 49 percent of female wokers work in the same sector in Indonesia. In this country such sector is more popular among men, 56 percent has job in it. 
Also, we need to pay our attention on the agriculture sector. It is obviously that this sector does not draw wokers attention in Australia. As we may see only 4 percent of the population work in it. But 29 percent of male and 43 percent of female wokers work in it in Indonesia. 
To sum up, we may conclude that Australia is more developped country in comperision with Indonesia.

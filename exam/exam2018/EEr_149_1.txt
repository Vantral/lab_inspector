The graph compares production of different energy sources in several countries. 
The most stable figure is related to the United States. The highest point of fossil fuels' energy production could be spotted in 1970 at sharply 95%. From that time, it has slowly been declining. Situation in France has been sharply similar for short period of time, when its figure reached 90%, almost equal to USA's calculations. However, after startling a bit from 1970 to 1975, it dropped dramatically with low of approximately 40% in 2015. 
Figures of China and India, on the contrary, have been rising gradually throughout the whole period from 1970 to 2015. Starting point of China had been 60%, which consequently rocketed to the calculation of almost 90%. Energy of India was spotted at 35% measurement in 1970 and has been showning upward tendency ever since, with highest point at 72% in 2015. 
Dramatic changes are depicted in figure of Sweden, whichreached all-time high at 80% in 1970 and plummeted after that to calculation of 45% in 1985. 
Figures of China and India represent upward tendency, whereas ones of France and Sweden are slowly decreasing. The United States calculations remain sharply constant.

Nowadays the question of influence in child's life is starting to be more and more significant. Different parts of argument have different opinion. First side claims that the influence of nurture in family is most powerful, and second side says that child's outside environment plays more important role. In my point of view, both family and outside factors like friends or school teachers are significant and help child to form his personality. 
Family gives child his nurture and foundation for a furthure formation. It teachs him how to speak and how to behave to different people, it warns child about dangers of the world. For example, infamous communication with unknown man in the street. 
Furthermore, family also gives it's child some basics of etiquet for his furthure communication with other children. Moreover, it gives a foundation for child's socialization outside the home. 
In most cases family also helps child to form his futher interest in life for animal, science or sports for example; outside environment may develop it then or totally change it, but especially family constructs most of child's interests in life. 
Then friends, school, teachers and other outside factors help child to socialize; child is learning how to communicate, he learns basics of ierarchy in environment. Child learns facts about formal communication with his teacher or any other adult; for instance, in South Korea child have to know different kinds of language's grammatic, formal and informal, to talk with older people and with his friends. It takes a great part in his personality's formation in society. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that the outside environment's influence may be called the continuation of family nurture. They both play role in child's life, and that would be difficult to imagine child's future without powerful participation of both of these parts.

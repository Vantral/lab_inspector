Every hour a new conflict or extreme accident occur in the world. The presidents of many countries tend to send help facilities or extra financing in sucj situations, without taking into account existinng problems in their own countries. I partially agree with the statement that a government should only deal with the problems of its state. 
On the one hand, sometimes a country overestimates its own resources. Sending money, rescue teams or food supplies can seriously undermine the economic stability of the country. For instance, Russian government spent a fortune on deploying military troops in war zones in Syria in order to stop the conflict and help peaceful civillians. Despite the fact that it was completely unneccessary, hence Russian government could invest this money into improving health care rather than fueling war conflicts in Syria. 
On the other hand, there are conclusive examples of countries which have no capability to manage occuring problems on their own. This proposal concerns mostly countries of the third world with unsustainable economic systems, therefore they find it hard to cope with emergency situations. For example, various earthquakes in Nepal which caused numerous casualties and fatalitieas. In thi case, Nepal had to call for help because it was not able to deal with it alone. That's why in such situations other countries should provide certain assist. 
On the whole, there are important arguments to support this idea. However, I still believe that every country should take practical measures taking into account their financial and social scope of the problems.

Some people believe that it is more important for a building to serve its purpose and architects should not worry about producing buildings that are works of art. Others consider that it is imortant for buildings to look beautiful. 
To my mind, I can partly agree for the second point of view. Undoubtaly, it is very important for buildings to look beautiful. We live in a big city, there are many office centres and people work all the time. This daily routine becomes ennoying and one of the things which can make such busy life better and less sressful is appearance of the city. When you walk to you work from metro or somewhere else, it is very pleasent to walk near these bautiful buildings. Evetyone knows that surrounding atmosphear is one of the most important things wchich influence on people's productive. That is why it is a good think to have in the city buildings wchich can make our day more positive and we can wantch on them as on the peace of art. 
On the other hand, peopole spend much time in the buildings. They work or study and finish all deals in the evening when it is dark outside. They have no time to pay attentiom on the buildingds. For such workers it is more important the atmosphear inside the building. In such situations architects should worry about inside plan of buildings. Also, I want to mention that there some regions which are appeared only for work class people. The work regions should look simle and do not cost much money beacause for government and econiomic situation of the country it would be difficult to pay money on all cities. 
In conlusion, I would like to add that architects should think more about atmosphear of the city. Both sides of buildings are important for people. Not all buildings need to be beautiful or a peace of art. The city and the buildings in it should just look pleasent.

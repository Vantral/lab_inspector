Now there is a heated debate whether states should help citizens of other governments or concentrate only on their own population because it is unfeasible to help everyone. In my view, countries should definitely pay attention to international problems and send help to suffering people even if they are living far away. 
The first reason for this is that many people in the world are suffering from various political issues even if they are innocent and not involved into international relations. By saying so I mean that such citizens should undoubtedly get help no matter which state can provide it. One example of it is current situation in Middle East. Although there is a global conflict dealing with many countries, the local peolpe need to live in a safer environment. 
Another important point is that some catastrophies are not caused by human beings but still may inflict a lot of damage on any country and cause fatalities. In particular, natural disasters are extremely dangerous and the consequences of them should be solved by the world governments simultaneously. Such cases happened when there were acrimonious droughts in Africa which resulted in the lack of water and local authorities could not solve it on their own. So the United Nations offered water and food for those developing countries and saved thousands of lives. 
Taking all into consideration, it is often impossible to deal with a global catastrophy for one single governments. But if many states gather their forces, the situation will get significantly better and the world will be a safer place.

Nowadays the question of child upbringing is discussed worldwide. One common opinion is that what influences on the childen development the most is the atmosphere in a family and, in contrast, the opponents consider external sources like friends and school as stronger influences. 
Personally, I think that there is no influence more powerful than the child's family. Indeed, the parents are usually those who answer all questions of their baby as it grows, acknowledge the world and overcome new borders. Moreover, officially parents make all important decisions connected with their children until they become mature. For instance, the family decides what school will their child pass or will he or she attend ballet or chess classes. Finally, the members of a child's family are undoubtedly the closest people for him or her as they stay in touch over the decades. 
However, those who held an opposite view usually argue that as children grow they get more information outside the family. They say that younger generation and especially teenagers mostly listen to their mates, or at least to the people they respect sincerely, for example, professors of their favourite subject in school. Nevertheless, at an invisible level of cohierence children stay unchanged when it comes to the general principales which have been aquired in the family. 
In conclusion, I would say that there are different opinions about the problem of child raising and upbringing, but both have strong arguments, therefore whether the main features of child's character are developed in home or outside is still a question of a debate.

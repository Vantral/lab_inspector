There is a belief that architects should worry only about safety of buldings but not about it's look. 
First of all, i would like to say that I am for 80 percent agree with that statement. And the main reason is - if archiects and workers will be thinking of how to build a safe and stable building of course the results will be definetly better than just thinking of beauty. It could cause very harmful and painful consequensase. They should consetrate on people's health. In our history there were too many cases where the problem was in architects desicion. We should learn something from history and do not make mistakes like that never again. 
Also there is no any particular need for buldings to be beautiful. Citizens can normally live with ordinary buldings. 
But also I have an opinion that all the buldings in Moscow, for example, are representing our country. And of course everyone wants to other people from different countries have a better opinion of us. We want to others think about our country only in a good way. I do not think it is a bad desire. When we are travelling the first thing we are consentrate of are beautiful buildings. 
To sum up, i would like to say that if i have a chance to choose what decision to make in this situation, i will choose a safe place instead of just work of art. It is a great responsibility to create such a value thing for people.

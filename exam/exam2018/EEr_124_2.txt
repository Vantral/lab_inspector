Nowadays, many people believe that looking beautiful is secondary for buildings because the most important for them is to serve their purposes. As for me, I cannot totally agree with this statement. Let me tell you the reasons. 
In my opinion, a building is created not only to let people use it for different things but also to be a part of our culture. Beautiful buildings become the sights that everyone in the world want to see. Besides, why should not we worry about the aesthetic part of the architecture? The unusial decisions and exciting appearance of a building will always make your day and people will feel much better. What is more, architects choose this profession because they have endless imagination, so just let them use it in their projects. 
For example, if a person works in an usual building, he has not any motivation to go there. However, if his workplace is a work of art, he is much more motivated to work in such a wonderful place, and he is in a good mood for all day. 
In conclusion, producing beautiful buildings is really important.

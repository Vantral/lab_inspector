In the modern world street art plays a significant role in urbanisation and nowadays we can witness a lot of buildings which are truly masterpieces. Nevertheless, there is a doubt in the architects community whether such decorative buildings should be projected and constructed. This essay agrees with that part of the community that stands for the realisation of beautiful buildings rather than the usual ones. 
To my mind, it is right to allow artists and architects to create and realise projects of unusual, outlandish constructions they come up with. Firstly, having colourful beautiful buildings, rather than the grey old ones, can improve the mood of the urban residents; therefore, it may even raise the sense of pride of their own city, which harbours such unique constructions. In addition, local tourism industry can benefit greatly (both, financially and in terms of popularity) from having such works of art in their area, as they may work as magnificent attractions for tourists from all over the world to visit this place. Finally, although such buildings as museums, theaters, even ministries, should, first of all, serve for their primary purpose, it is necessary to pay attention to its appearance, because the outer view is what wee see first, and it can influence what we think about it in advance. 
All in all, I believe that it is more than necessary to develop the sense of beautiful by allowing inspired architects to decorate buildings in a beautiful way, no matter how much time and effort it takes because such constructions might well be the heritage that we will save for further generations to feast their eyes on it, so we should take good care of how they look.

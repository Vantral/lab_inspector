There is a great dispute upon different purposes of buildings. Some people think that buildings should look beautiful, while oters claim that it is not important for architects to make art of buildings. Who is right? Let us try to make it clear. 
As for me, buildings do need to combine serving practical needs and looking beautiful. Firstly, it would be very hard for people to spend their lives looking at the same ugly buildings every day. The great number of big cities inhabitats nowadays usually feel depressed because of their everyday routine. I think that wrong atmosphere makes it even worse and non-natural views appear to be one of the most significant parts of the atmosphere in the city. Sad people are ineffective people. Secondly, some people believe that making buildings beautiful and useful is the main work of an architect. I agree with this point of view because harmony was one of the most important purposes of the human race from the very beginning of civilization. Our feeling of harmony and pleasure caused by its observation is a part of our nature. 
On the other hand, not everybody share my point of view. Some people think that beauty is useless for buildings because beautiful building always need to sacrifice its usefullness. I do not agree with this statement. As for me, the only topic to discuss here is the priorities. People should always keep in mind that buildings cannot be divided at beautiful but useless and ugly but useful. We should always look for the balance. 
To sum up, I can say that the topic of my essay stays debatable. But I continue to believe that buildings should be constructed taking the balance between beauty and practical needs into consideration.

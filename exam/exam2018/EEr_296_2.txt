The question of building design has never been discussed as much as nowadays. As we have an opportunity to change the way our cities look it is important to decide whether architecture should be more useful than beautiful or not. 
In my opinion, aesthetic part of building appearence is highly important because it creates the tone of surronding athmosphere which is supposed to be friendly in order to function well. Moreover, beautifully designed buildings can make your country famous and attractive for turists. For example, many people go to Spain to see Gaudi's designes or to Saint-Petersbourg to visit Isaac's Cathedral. The last but not the least, beautiful architecture tends to live longer as there are many societies to preserve masterpieces from ruining. 
However, functional design is also esssential and very popular with architects in the past few decades. The main reason for that is that nowadays many cities are overpopulated and there is a need for free space to create places for living. Appart from that, when the purpose of the building finds itself in way the house is constructed it saves the time of its users as you can find facilities you are looking for easier and faster. 
Summing up, it is necessary to combine these to major approaches - beauty and functionality - when planning a new architectural construction. As for me, I prefer buildings which look plesant outside and are well organised inside.

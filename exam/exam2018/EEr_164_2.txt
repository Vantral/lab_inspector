There are several factors that affect a child's life: its family, friends, the school where he or she is studying at and other. From my point of view, there is not only one factor that influences a lot on a child's life. We should see the situation as a whole, as a variety of different factors. 
To begin with, I am pretty sure that family is one of the key factors that forms the child's life. The family is with you from the very beginning of your life. You always keep in touch with your family members at least when you are a little kid. It is clear that a child's mind is like a piece on paper on which you can write different things and,obviously, what is right and what is wrong. Consequently, a mother and a father are the very first people that "write" something on this piece of paper, in other words, they shape a child's mind. 
On the other hand, some outside factors may influence a lot on a child's development, too. When a child begins to attend school or takes part in some courses, the people that he or she sees and hears affect a child in the way he or she thinks and behaves. So, to some extent, they influence on a child's development. 
To sum up, there are lots of factors that effect on a child's life. It is very important to understand that we should take into account not only the influence by home, but also different outside factors, that may play a significant role in a child's development.

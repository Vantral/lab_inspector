Nowadays, there is a tendency in whilch people prefer working in order to get more money and not having enough time for their leisure activities. On the contrary, others choose to put their duties aside to have spare time for relaxation and not bothering themselves with the money question. 49
To begin with, the first point of view has its' focuse on earning a lot and having more materialistic advantage from life, like gaining success and money, having a bank account full of savings and etc. Obviously, clear pros of the situation are the rising income and self-esteem due to the fact that the person's positions gets upper at the same time while his or her income rises. Many people assume that being rich resolves all the challenges in life and it makes them satisfied with the quality of their lifes and the goals they get. 
Moving forward, we should not forget that not only one point of view exists and it is not for all the people to feel better while having money and collecting respect from others. Psycologically, the other type of socialization includes being content with the surroundings, feeling free and enthusiastic which is hardly possible while being in the atmosphere of stress and pressure at work all day long. Scientists claim that it is a fact that some people do not neccessarily need to have a high income to be free and it is essential for them to feel an amount of leisure time behinde their backs. 
To conclude the information collected above, remembering the fact that it always depends on personal circumstances, I would like to say that personally I prefer the second type of living where it is not the work which shapes your life and creates all the goals and achievments, but you yourself who decides if it is obligatory to work hard or now it is time to have a gap in the continuous reel of running towards new doings and research.

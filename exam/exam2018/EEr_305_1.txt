The graph illustrates the gap in earnings of males and females in five different countries over a period of 15 years. 
On the whole, the income difference decreased considerably by the year 1995 as compared to 1980. However, in the countries where this figure used to be significant (for example, Japan and the UK) it remained higher than in those where the earnings of both sexes have been almost equal from the 1980s. 
As can be seen from the graph, the salary difference in New Zealand and Germany has always been rather low in comparison to other countries. However, in both regions this percentage has lowered by around 10 percent over this period of time. While New Zealand presented a steady tendency, in Germany the income rate fluctuated and grew by approximately two percent between 1990 and 1995. 
The most considerable gap between male and female income can be observed in Japan, where men used to earn 40 percent more than women in 1980, as well as in the USA. The latter, however, showed a steady decline to the 20 percent difference, while in Japan it only reached 30 percent. In the UK the figure decreased steadily, too, from around 36 percent in 1980 to approximately 23 percent difference in 1995.

The graph illustrates how much percent of energy from fossil have five develop countries from different part of the world in a year from 1970 to 2015. 
The graphs gives the information about China, United States, India, France and Sweden. 
In the 1970th USA has the highest percent of energy of fossil among all given countries, more than 90 percent. Although the tendency of amaount of energy of fossil in China tends to draw from 1980s but not dramatically, only from more than 90 percent to less than 80 percent. By 2015 THE USA still holds this percentage. Nowdays a country that take the first plac among the written above countries is Chinawith 90 persent of fossil. However in 1970 China had only 60 percent of fossil. But from the middle of 80s China made a big leap and started to grow the amount of fossil very quickly. 
India had the same tendency as China. Starting only from 35 percent of fossil in 1970s, India had made a huge grow to 70 percent of oil by 2015. 
But two europeian countries France and Sweden had absolutely different situation. Both countries had more than 80 percent of fossil in 1970s, but in 1980s they started losing their position on the world area. By 2015 France has only 40 percent of fossil and Sweden has a stronger falling to only less than 30 percent of energy of fossil by 2015.

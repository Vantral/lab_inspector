There is an idea that it is much more relevant for the buildings to be useful for its purpose than beautiful. History gaved us quite a lot of such an examples. However I cannot totally agree with this opinion. 
I stick to the idea, that architecture is the same piece of visual art as paiting, sculpture or cinematography. All of this artforms are transferring two importnat ideas: the idea of bringing the joy to our eye and to try to teach us some moral ideas. Architecture is having quite the same purposes. Even though second aim of the architecture is different from the other art forms: buildings are made for people to work and to live in, and not having any didactic ideas, it is still the form of art, and we should not postpone it. 
Moreover, architecture surronding us everywhere we live, and if it would be just usefull, but not beautiful our life would be quite borring and depressive. Phsycologists claim that in sleeping areas of downtowns, where bulidings looks like a huge dark boxes, serving just one purpose to accomodate people, a person feel themeselves much more depresed and uncomfortable, than those, who live in wonderful areas of old city. Furthermore we do not have to forget about the tourist, according to the statistics, the main income of European countries comes from tourism and people visit Rome or Paris particulary to observe impressive barocco bulidings in France or huge and spectacular architecture of ancient Rome. 
Nevrtheless, we totally have to make buildings comfortable, serving and thinking about its main purpose, but we have to make a great balance between a beautiful artform and usefull building. 
To sum up, i think that architecture is also a piese of visual art aand we should not negelct the importance of making it beautiful.

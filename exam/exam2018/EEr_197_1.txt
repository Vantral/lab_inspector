The given table illustrates information about the number of working 3 different spheres people of both genders in Indosesia and Australia. The data is presented for the 2010 and it is given in percentage. The trend is the amount of male and female workers in given sectors in both countries. 
To begin with, the first table presents data collected in Indonesia. Industry is a sector with the least percent of people employed, with 15 and 8 percent of male and female workers each. While the agriculture branch stays in the middle, the services are the trendy sector of employment in this country where female workers are just under male ones with 49 percent and with 56 percent of male workers. 
The second graph depict workers employes in 3 given spheres in Australia. We may see that unlike in Indonesia agricultural sector takes the last position. It may be due to the climate differences in two coutries. Similarly to the situation in Indonesia sphere of services is the most common to work in for women and men from both countries. However, in the Australia there are much more female workers in this unit that take nearly 90 percent and female workers with only 65 percent. Industry is not that trendy as services sphere is. 
To conclude, with the sphere of services being the most common in both Indonesia and Australia I would like to point out that their economies are not that different as they may seem to you from the fisrt glance. Even though their climates differ they are both contries depended on tourism and even though their climates differ thus they may share expiriences to creat a sustainable society in the future.

The line graph presents the information about the countity of energy producted by using fossil fuels in different countries between 1970 and 2015. The percentage of producting the energy from the fuels increased in eastern countries - India and Chine, whereas in the USA, France and Sweden the level of production dropped. 
The immidiate changes in the countity of usage of fossil fuels can be observed in France and Sweden. The tendency to decrease can be seen in the end of 20th century, notably, that since 1995 up to 2015 the results of usage are more stable. In India and China the growth was consistent. In India up to 2015 the amount of usage doubled. The usage in the USA decreased also consistently and dropped for 10%. The lines of France and Sweden look equal, but the production in Sweden reached its lowest point - only about 10% of energy is produced by fossil fuels up to 2015. 
As a result, in 2015 China, the USA and India have the highest percentage in comparison with other contries.

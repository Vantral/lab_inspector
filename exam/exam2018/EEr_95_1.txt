The chart shows a percentage difference in income between men and women in different countries between 1980 and 1995. 
In 1980 in Japan, USA and UK was a huge difference in salaries. Men got 35-40% more money than women did. In Japan this value even got over 40% in 1985. However, the main tendency for all of them is lowering the diffence. It decreases since 1980 in both USA and UK and in Japan since 1985 it falls too. USA has a best result in lowering difference: it rapidly halved from almost 40% to 20%. 
Germany and New Zealand had 20-25% difference in income from the beginning. In New Zealand it was almost steady during 1980-1985, then it dropped between 1985-1990 and continued decreasing in 1990-1995. At 1995, New Zealand as like as USA halved the difference, reached a bit more than 10%. 
Difference in income in Germany has been falling down dramatically from 23-25% to 10% until the year 1990. In 1990 it suddenly increases and in 1995 reaches a value greater than New Zealand's one. Perhaps, some government mistakes could take a place - or something else happened. No other country has a similar rise. 
To sum up, it seems like all 5 countires are on the right way to minimize difference in income between men and women. In last years in Germany it increased again, but just for a bit. Japan still a huge difference of 30%, but this difference semms to get lower in the next years.

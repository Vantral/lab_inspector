Nowadays there is a belief that for a building it is more important to serve its purpose rather than to look stunning. Architects are supposed not to think about the beauty of buildings when they construct them. In my opinion, all the buildings should look attractive for the eyesight. 
To begin with, when a building is constructed the architect should pay attention to its appearance for other human beings because it represents a country's heritage. A building's style may say a lot about its history. When people visit different countries first of all they want to see the architecture of a certain country, so it would be more pleasable for them to be facinated by a beautifully constructed building because they will desire to know more about its history and the architect. For example, last year I was paid a visit by my foreign friend and when I asked her what if it was important for her if the building was beautiful and awe-inspiring. She told me that a building should look attractive to attract millions of visitors who travel to a country or who just live in this area in order to inspire them to build the same buildings and be proud of ingenuity of human race. 
Moreover, for human beings who live in abandoned and demolished places one of the joys that would make them happy and satisfied is the construction of stunning buildings. Besides,it will be a good incentive for their children to contemplate a career in architecture when they grow up. Instead of becoming, for example, a thief they may be likely to choose a profession of an architect. More than that, when a modern building is designed well, it is painted in bright colours rather than dark ones, it will be almost always more pleasable to work in such a place. 
To conclude, I believe modern architects should make buildings more beautiful because they depict our history, architecture style and heritage. Therefore, architects should bear in mind how their buildings will look like.

Nowadays many people claim that governments should cooperate and contribite to problem-solving of other countries, while others believe that one country does not have a capability to be helpful to all people on the Earth. From my perspective, countries should be supportive to each other in any cases for two reasons. 
First of all, nowadays there is a theory of boomerang that means if you want someone to help you in the future, you should behave the same way. Therefore, people need to exchange their help in order to survive on our planet. Secondly, in order to maintain good relationships with other countries we need to interact and help. Such actions will improve the diplomatic relationships and enhance world stability, in general. This opens huge opportinities for the development of globalisation that will broaden horizons and will give opportunities to gain scientific and technological achievements and advances collectively. There is a strong correlation between all these process. Being helpful to each other is a keystone of a developed country. 
Nevertheless, some people completely disagree with such point of view. They assume that nowadays there are many directions where a country is able to channel its help. There is the abudance of those who are desirable to recieve support. In order to stay economically stable and not to stay out of resourses, countries need to be self-sufficient. 
In conclusion, there are two options: to be open, friendly and helpful or to be strict, self-sufficient and unwelcome for others. I suppose that if a government is able to provide someone with help and it does not affect the country as a whole and the life of its citizens, country should try to condition problems of others, to send resources or to make something to help.

In recent years, our world faced a great amount of crucial problems, connecting with environment, people, their health, economy and so on. Almost all heads of states try to make their best to provide people from their own countries with all opportunities and needs. However, should goverments help other countries to struggle problems or just concentrate on their own? 
To start with, I would like to say, that we live in sociaty where everyone is collaborating with someone. A person cannot live alone because he or she needs not only to communicate with somebody but also needs to recieve help or to share it with others. That is why, I strongly believe that countries have to focus not only their own problems but look after smaller and weaker too. To support my view, I would like to give an example of African people who do not have vibrant cities to attract tourists and money with them. They have bad land and it leads to poor economy. I do not think that because of that children and adult who live in Africa should suffer and live with a lack of food and water. 
What is more, every country can face a sudden problem which can destroy several systems inside of it: economy, medicine, education and others. For instance, during the World War people in Leningrad did not have even food and because of that many of them died. A lot of people were killed. In such situations other countries should try to prevent or if it happens to stop such actions. 
To conclude, it follows as a logical consequense that all people should not ignore problems of others because we all live on the Earth and in one society.

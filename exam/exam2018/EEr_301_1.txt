The graph shows how different was income of women and men in five countries during a 15-year period at the end of the twentieth century. 
The shown countries can be divided into two groups based on the first percent meaning in 1980: Japan, the USA and the UK placed approximately 35-40% and Germany and New Zealand were near twice lower with % of 20-23. 
In all the countries except Japan and Germany the gap in men and women income was slowly decreasing throughout all period. The rise of the difference in Japan took place before the main fall, between 1980 and 1985. Comparing it with the USA, it can be seen that even if both graphs begin with 40% meaning, the second points of them make a gap of 10%. Germany, however, had a small increase not before, but after the whole decrease whose tendency the other four countries seem to follow. 
The whole situation is positive for women: the difference between their and men' earnings fell by 10-20% in five world countries and probably keeps falling since 1995.

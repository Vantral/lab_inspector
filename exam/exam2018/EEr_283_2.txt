It is widely belived that more things have influence on person. Some people have a meaning that family is the biggest par of our life and because of this it has more influence on person than life around he or she like friends and school. However, other people think contrary. 
On the one hand, child spent a lot of time in his or her family. Parents give some patterns of behavior to their children. Some children in the childhood often wanted to grow up and to be like their mother of father. Children see behavior of their parents and try to repeat it. That is why family has powerful influence on child's life. 
On the other hand, when child grow up and go to school, he or she meet new people in their life. They meet friends and start to repeat they hobbits and behavior. Often children's interests and parents' one have more differences and then children start to tell about their problems and thoughts with his or her friends, but not with parents. Because of this influences from outside the home. 
I think, it is not easy to decide what more important between these two meanings. The first decides children do in their family, their learn not only talk, but thinking, too. Parents give their children some advices and child can hear them and do what their want. However, child can do what he or she decide to do. I think, it is influences from outside the home. Person has more information in social networks, internet and he or she can take personal opinion because of this. 
To sum up, personal character depends on more factors around he or she. Family and life from outside the home have influence on person, but it different influence. Someone take more thoughts or patterns of behavior in their family, another one is interested in friend's or teacher's advises, it depends only on child's choose and has not the biggest or the least part in person's life.

The line graph provides data about how much energy power produced from fossil fuels is used by five countries over a 45-year period starts from 1970 percentagewise. 
Overall, as it can be seen from the graph, percentage numbers of France and Sweden decreased significantly at the set period. 
For instance, in year 1970 France was on the second place in the rate of countries which uses energy from fossil fuels, however, the using of this kind of energy started to reduce after five years and fall to the lowest point of almost 45 per cents in 2015. It is clear that Sweden has a fairly similar pattern. 
In the same time, China and India started to produce more energy by fossil fuels. At the beginning of set period their figures were 60 and 35 percent, but in 2015 the percentage number of India rose more than by 30 percent, and China's one almost to 90 percent.

Some peeople beleive that purpose is more significant in building than its beauty. Arcitects do not need to care about creating buildings as artworks. 
Personally I mostly support this opinion, and it is going to be proved on the example of Moscow. 
Nowadays Moscow is a megapolis and has the biggest amount of habitants in Russia. The city has its historical centre, where ancient beautiful buildings are. Furthermore, there is a plenty of cotteges in Moscow's outskirts, that were some famous people's countryhouses in the past. Some of such buildings are not very comforlable to live in, however they look aesthetical. 
Another reason why the purpose is more indispensable than the appearence in the case of living house is the temp of the building. It is obvious that beautiful ones demand far more time, often more than a few years. If in the city there are more habitants than houses, the number of the buildings is before their beauty. 
Another issue is that all in all they are built far away from the city centre, that is why the most find it less attractive than the city centre. 
To sum it all up, in megapolises creation of beautiful buildings does not play an important role. The city lives in a crazy living temp and the purpose comes to the foreground almost in each aspects.

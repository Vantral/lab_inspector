Students of 40 years old and above consist only 15%. However, this age-category prevailed in attending art courses. There were 30% of 18 to 25 years old students, and there were only 25% of 26 to 40 years old people attended this type of courses. But it shoud be noticed that this age-category deliberated in the last type of courses. There were 62% of 26 to 40 years old students, which attended sports and health courses.

Today the world faces with a huge number of problems an catastrophes and people should suffer this casualties. There is a strong belief among some people that governments should not contribute with each other in terms of providing help or support due to numerous reasons. This essay is aimed to give a persuasive opinion why a government should merely center its attention on its own nation and issues. 
The prosperous country is a place where the government backs up its own people. To begin with, the main goal of every government is to provide the safety and comfort for its population. Secondly, the government should have a deep sense of concern of its inner social situation: its requirements and targets. For example,in european countries if a terroristic happens, there is a plenty of police and medical staff on the streets which show that government would not let the another catastrophe to happen. 
Focusing on the issues of the own country might be an efficient example for developing countries to follow. Firstly, if the country does not admit any charity activities in order to help poor people in devastated countries, it shows its own path to thrive. For example, China is one the most efficacious countries in economic and social aspects. However, it is a well-known fact that China undertakes support actions to other nations very rare. The society in China, although, cannot be considered arrogant or hostile. The example of China encourages its neighbours to act simmilarly and to achieve probably the same progress. 
To conclude, it can be fairly sayed that the governments worldwide should take practical steps to meet the needs of its own people without relying on the help of other powers.

There is a common belief that governments ought to help only those, who live in a particular country, rather than spend time and money on citizens of other places in the world. To speak about me, I am completely agree with this statement. 
The thing is we live in the epoch of extended consumerism, thus soon there will be not enough resources for everybody in a planet. That is the reason, why governments should focus on preserving them for those, who live in their own country. Spending natural resourses and sharing them with other places will lessen the possibility of their usage in the future for all the countries. In my opinion, it is better to take care of lives of those people, who live in the country with such resources. If the government workers do that, they will provide a prosperous future for further generations. 
Secondly, people who have chosen the job of polititian in a government are to be aware of situation in their own country as they have everything to follow all the tendencies that happen in the society. Undoubtedly, government workers do not always have broad opportunities of helping people from other countries. That is why it is better to concentrate on their own nation and make better life conditions, using all the power they have. 
To sum up, it is crusial to help those people, who live in their own countries. I belive, that if government workers focus only on the problems of the citizens, they will successfully cope with them and make the life in the place much better.

Nowdays there are a lot of discusses about the role of family in a modern society. Some people believe that family affects a child's life less than other outside influences. However, others argue that family takes the biggest part in a child's life. The question is: what point of view is more reasonable? 
It's a common knowledge today that children has an abundant amount of opportunities to communicate with outside world. I mean the access to internet, predominantly. Surfing the internet has strong consequences for children's development, undoubtdly. For instance, there are a lot of materials in the internet that should be cencored. However, children has an admission to the such kind of content. And a family - frequently - has no possibilities to restrict their children's freedom in using internet. Another source of influence in children is the communication with their classmates (if they are no learned at home). It's obviously that today children spend most of their time at school or/and in internet. Thus, unfortunately, parents cannot to take care about their children in a sufficient way. 
However, there are some examples of a sort of an other situations. For instance, there are some families with a traditional view of bringing up their children. In case when one of the parents (or even both of them) spend most of their time at home, they could nurture their children at the early stage of their development, at least. Meanwhile, it should be noticed, that there is an opinion in scientific circles that the most important part of a person's development is his/her childhood. Therefore, in this case we should recognize that the role of family can prevail in a child's life. 
Taking into consideration all mentioned above, I suppose that although in the majority of cases children are doomed to grow by themselves, there are some excludes which demonstrate that families with traditional tenets of nurturing exist.

It is wideky belived that the main idea of buildings is serving their purpose than to look beautiful, so architects should not make their projects as works of art. In my view, this opinion is wrong and there must be much more beautiful buiildings in cities. 
First of all, it is a famously known fact that both design and architecture is not only about look of buildings, they also serve some purposes like making more light and air in big cities by using glass. Moreover, architects study materials, so they will be able to make not only good-looking building, but comfortablee too. For example, some buildings are painted in white colours to make an atmosphere calmer and more enjoyable to people who live there and who tire of grey noisy town. 
Secondly, simple buildings without any creative things can affect people who live or work in there. Moder life is full of stress and anxiety, so good-loking city landscape may make people happier or less stressed, because it is a good therapy to look on something beautiful. For example, if person works in some office, it could be much better for him or her to go home looking at beautiful and creative architecture. 
Finally, buildings without any special desigh could destroy the architectural ctyle of any city, so people will not enjoy their cities and towns and will complain and regret about it. 
To sum up, it is clearly seem, that it is important for buildings not only for serve their purpose, but to look good to.

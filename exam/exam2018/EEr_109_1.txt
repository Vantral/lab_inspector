The graph illustrates the changes in percentage of income between men and women in five different contries over a 15 year perioud - between 1980 and 1995. Overall, it can be seen that men and women in Japan had the highest percentage of income all over the period. Started with 40 percent in 1980 the ratio negligibly rose to 42% in 1985 then it steadily decreased untill the percentage of income reached 30% in 1995. In 1980 the income in Japan accounted for 35%. 
A closer look at the graph reveals that to carry out this evaluation it is better to look at paired cases because some countries showed sillilar pattern during this 15 year period: Germany and New Zeland, Great Britain and the USA. The percentage of earnings between men and women in 1980 in the USA was slightly higher than that of Great Britain - about 39% and 36% relatively. Then it decreased all over the period and reached its lowest percentage in 1995 - 20% in the USA and just about 24% in Great Britain. In 1985 and 1990 the percentage of earnings was negligibly higher in United Kingdom than that of the USA. 
While Japan had the highest proportion of income between both genders all over 15 year period, the group of Germany and New Zeland, on the contrary, had the lowest percentage of earnings. Started in 1980 with about 23% in Germany and a fifth in New Zeland, it fluctuated all over the period and reached 13% in 1995. 
All in all, the income in Japan was far higher than that of New Zeland and Germany

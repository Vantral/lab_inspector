Nowadays there are numerous alarming problems that the international community has to tackle. Since it seems unfeasible to provide aid for all people who struggle, it is sometimes asserted that the government should prioritize national problems rather than the global ones. Personally, I believe that it is more beneficial to pay attention to the issues on both these levels. 
There are some strong reasons to reinforce such an approach. First and foremost, today we live in the global world, where literally every country is connected with other ones and, as a result, depends on them drastically. This fact ensures the vast majority of the problems can be solved only under the conditions of international cooperation. To illustrate this point, let us take such significant problems that many countries face as economic crisis and poverty. Basically, they have a dramatic impact on the whole world, including even the wealthiest countries, therefore, it is not plausible to eliminate them locally. 
One more ground for holding such an opinion that should be taken into consideration is the scale of the threat that some of the problems pose to humanity in the 21st century. It is a well-known fact that, actually, they jeopardise our very existance as a species and may eventially eradicate our planet. For instance, escalation of the problem of terrorism, spread of mortal diseases or pollution can have appaling implications. If a country completely ignores the necessity of the joined effort to overcome the critical situation and restricts its policy only to the national scale, finally, it still will be affected by the global problems. 
To conclude, though there are different points of view about this controvertial issue, I am inclined to believe that it is far more beneficial for the government to maintain the balance between its effort on global and local level rather then prefer one of them.

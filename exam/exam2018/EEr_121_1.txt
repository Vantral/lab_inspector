The graph demonstrastes to which extent, given in percent, men's and women's salaries differed in five countries from 1980 to 1995. 
Overall, it can be noticed that the difference had become more striking by the end of the period. However, some countries showed trend which can be described as more incosistent ones than others. 
It is noted that Germany and New Zealand were the countries where the difference was minimum in 1980, as well as in 1995. While the USA, Japan, and the UK were at the point of approximately 40% in 1980, Germany and New Zealand's point was just around 20%. The USA was the only country to show a consisent fall of the percentage difference in income between the sexes. There was a constant decrease which eventually resulted in a 20% drop. The UK, Japan, and New Zealand demonstrated a similar tendecy with a slight increase in percentage around 1985. Japan then had a peak of more than 40% income difference. Over the 15 year-old period, all the three countries had a decrease of nearly 10%. Germany was the one to stand out with a constant fall until 1990 and a slight rise after. By 1990, the difference percentage had dropped from 23% to 10% in Germany. Then, during the next 5 years a rise of 3% took place. 
To sum up, the graph shows that the percentage difference in salaries between men and women had a common tendency to decrease in all the five countries.

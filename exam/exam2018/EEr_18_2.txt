In today's world, with the increase in popularity of launching numerous charity organizations, there is a heated debate upon whether it is feasible to give a hand to all citizens of the world. As far as I am concerned, governments should actively help people across the globe since it is a genuinely motivating way to live in peace and harmony with the rest of the world. 
Firstly, a multitude of charity institutes should be created to provide the needy with all crucial supplies or to combate deadly diseases together. Such actions will show the right example to future generations and convince governments to take part in helping people from various corners of the world. For example, I had such an experince when I lived in Georgia and joined the local volunteers to help my native town be renovated after the horrific consequences of the war that took place in 2008. 
Secondly, implementing programmes centered on helping other countries will definitely pay off later as it consequently will strenghten the relations between different countries, for instance, in political, economic or social spheres. As I see it, cooperative work always bears fruit. For instance, those countries who were in need in the past will certainly reach out a hand to the countries that helped them survive through the hard times. 
To sum up, I am deeply convinced that spreading the importance of global help is the most beneficial and stimulating way to reach peace, harmony and understanding relationships between diverse countries, especially in the world that constantly faces social conflicts and terrorist attacks.

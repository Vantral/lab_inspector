Nowadays many people believe that family plays such an important role in people's childhood. Others claim that there are some outside influences which take place in child's life. 
A family is a nesseserry devise for a kid development. Moms and dads learn their son or dauhter family values and stuff. Thanks for family members a children discovery such thing like love, Loylty, strengh,spirit. Moreover, only mother can take a soft care of her child in a pleasent atmosphere. For example, a big family which consists of 5 members: mother, father, grandmother and two brothers. It automatically learns two boys to be kind, friendly, to apritiate old people and more. 
But there are people who srtongly believe that all stages of socialization can be overcome ourside a home. First of all, children lern how to survive in modern world themselves. They explore this planet without any support. It makes them stronger and more sitable for the reality. Furthermore, kids make diversity strong bonds with people, they communicate with each other, that is why they also found out love, friendship and so on. For example, chieldren become more intellegent when they found themselves in uncomortable situation outside than at sweet home. A flourishing world suggests a lot of real situations and behevior models which absolutely will help a kid in his or her future life. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that outside influenses are more powerfull than family in general. It provedes children to make theit own dessisions from very early age. Also, there more opportunities to make friend with loads of people, family cannot afford it.

Some people believe that to make people's life richer and to provide citizens with better support the idea of owning countries by the governments can take place. I for on am certain this viewpoint is wide from the truth. 
Firstlly, there is a risc to make the reletionshps with other countries worse by refusing to give help or support to homeless citizens of other regions. It is essential to realize that provoding support to the poor population of other countries the goverment will have an opportunity to make strong reletionships with it. 
Moreover, the government will have en extremely good reputation and wil get some donotation. 
Secondly, spreading support all around the wotld the government encourages others to do it. We should take into concideration, that such precidure will build an international community. Over and above, by providing worldwide help the government improves its international trade. 
To conclude, there is a welth of opportunities for the government to help to the huge number of citizens, without using the idea of owning countries.

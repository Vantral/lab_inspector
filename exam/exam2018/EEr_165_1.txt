The charts provide the information on the attendance of courses in three spheres by student populations of different ages. For science courses, more than half of the audience turn out to be between 18 and 25 years old, while for arts the biggest group of 45% consists of people over 40, and sports and health courses are most popular with 26-40 year olds, who make up 62% of attendants. However, this category of courses proves least popular among the youngest group, whereas for the oldest attendants it is science, both drawing only 15% of students under 25 and over 40 respectively. The arts courses seem to be most equally attractive for all age groups, as the difference in size between the biggest and smallest population in the audience is within 20% there, unlike in both other spheres where it is between 40% and 50%. Overall, it seems that most students prefer to get involved in science at first as their main field and then proceed to improve their physical condition via sports or pick up arts for broader range of skills and activities.

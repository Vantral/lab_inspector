It is widely argued what has more affect on a growing child: her/his relatives with whom they live or external communication? 
This essay will discuss both points of view. In the essay we will look at some different life situations and try to find out when one source of influence changes another one and is it possible to concrete which one is more strong. 
It is obvious that in a particular, the first perioud of life parents and siblings are the only people who interact with a new born baby. Communication with them can develop some thing for the end of the life. We know that children mostly became bilingual if members of their family speaks two or more languages. 
One may say that if someone is living in a wealthy family, she or he will have more opportunities. For example, to read more interesting books, to visit museums and theatres, to travel more, to have better education than kids from middle or lower class. Due to these privilegies that chirdren seem to be more developed and aknowledged. 
On the other hand, we cannot despite the fact that since school age, friends and classmates have an extremely strong influence on a child (or a teenager). I know it from my friend experience: when she was finishing a high school, she claimed that she would study journalism with her boyfriend instead of studying law as her parents were wondering. This situation shows that sometimes, especially when a human has grown enough, friends or beloved ones could change even someone's way of life. 
In my opinion, the power of family's influence depends on the age of a child. I suppose that until they have not got many social connections, family stands on the first place. But when it comes to teen age, the affect from outside the home starts to be as important as the one from inside the home.

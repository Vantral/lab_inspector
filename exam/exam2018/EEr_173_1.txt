There are three charts which are showing people of different age attending various courses in a UK college in 2012. 
The first chart shows 650 students who chose to study science courses. People who are up to 25 years old dominate the chart, taking more than half of it. The rest is shared between older people. 
The second chart describes 600 students who attended arts courses. This time, people who are up to 40 years old still take more than half of the diagram, but this proportion is shared between two separate age groups. The rest of the diagram is taken by much older people. 
The third chart depicts 630 students who took sports and health courses. People between 26 and 40 years old take over the half of the chart. The rest is shared between people of younger ages. 
Overall, we can see that people who are younger than 40 years old are more willing to attend college courses than odler age groups.

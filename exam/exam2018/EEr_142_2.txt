There is the statement that it is more important for a building to serve its purpose than to look beautiful, while others believe, that rchitects should not worry about producing buildings that are works of art. I disagree with the first statement because of several reasons. 
The first reason is the fact, that our life is really hard and buildings around us can really make our mood better by it's beautiful construction or bride and fresh color. The second cause why i disagree whith the first opinion is a fact, that having significant buildings give chance to take first place of tourism in the world, because peple in traveling want get new feelings by watching extraordinary places and amazing architecture, so it is very important to try make buildings in city more beautiful and attractive. 
In conclution I want to say, that appearence of buildings play a vital role in developing of tourism of city and citizens lifestyle and I hope, that architect will pay attention to this fact.

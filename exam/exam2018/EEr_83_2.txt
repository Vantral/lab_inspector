Nowadays some people believe that the family has the biggest influence in child's life while other people think that the influence of friends, schoolmates and other people and things is more powerful than the family. Let me start by considering the opinions. 
Firstly, the family is very essential for development child, his abilities and his goals. The family is an example for feature life of kids. Parents give different lessons of life. They share their experience and tell how make something better. Consequently, the family has large influence in child's life. 
Secondly, the influences from outside the home also help child to understand something. The relationships with friends and other people learn how to be in different situation. Sometimes children copy behavior of their friends and also they can want to be like celebrities. The influence of life outside the home also is so powerful. 
As for my opinion, the family's unflunce is stronger than influence from friends and other people because our parents never want bad for us whereas there are a lot of people in life who want to harm. Some friends can be ureal and they can give a bad habitats. There are many discoveries that show the big bond between the family and child. I believe that people often copy their family, the habitats and behaviour of their parents. 
Taking into consideration of different opinions, I think that there are a lot of factors which influence in any child's life but the most powerful and influent category is family.

The given graph illustrates the difference in percentage of income of men and women throughout the period of 1980 to 1995. There are five countries analysed in this field: Japan, the USA, UK, Germany, and New Zealand. It can be observed that the biggest overall difference took place in Japan (from 30 to 40 per cent), while the smallest was in Germany and New Zealand (approximately 12-23 and 11-20 per cent correspondingly). In general, the difference in earnings between men and women tended to decline, reaching the lowest value by the end of the time span (except for Germany, where a small increase took part in the last third of the period). 
From 1980 to 1985, the percentage difference rose in Japan (from 40 to approximately 41 per cent), while the other four countries experienced a decrease. The most dramatic fall took place in the USA and Germany, each by around 9 per cent. 
The most stable percentage decline in all the five countries occured during the period from 1985 to 1990. Meanwhile, from 1990 to 1995 the trend became less sharp in the USA, UK, and New Zealand, remained stable in Japan, and altered in Germany: there was an increase by approximately 2 per cent.

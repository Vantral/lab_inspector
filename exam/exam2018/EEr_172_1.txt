Three pie charts presented below show the percentage of different age groups attending various college courses. Those age groups are the following: 18-25 year olds, 26-40 year olds and 40 year olds and above. Interestingly enough, each college course shows different results. 
The first chart describes the attendees of the science courses. The youngest age group form a substantial majority - 55%, meanwhile the figures for the elder people are lower: 26-40 year olds account for 30% and people over 40 are only 15%. 
However, the data on the second pie chart is in a sharp contrast to that of the first one. The people over 40 contribute to 45% of the attendees, 18-15 year olds are only 30% of the respondents, finally, the age group of 24-40 year olds has only 25%. This observation reveals a different pattern of attendance in the science and the arts courses. 
The information shown on the third graph, that describes Sports and Health courses, seems quite different from the previous ones. The astonishing majority of students is from the group of 25-40 year olds - namely, 62% - the other age groups have small numbers. 
To conclude with, it is difficult to notice any similar patterns in those graphs as the holders of the 1st and 2nd places change every time. However, we can see that different activities are preffered by different age groups, and I think that it is the main point of these charts.

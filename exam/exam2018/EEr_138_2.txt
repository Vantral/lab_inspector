There are two opinions - first is that it is more important for a building to serve its purpose than to look beautiful and second - architects should not worry about producing buildings that are works of art. 
I cannot totally agree with both these opinions. What about the first statement, I agree than it is really important for a bulding to be safety, because there are a lot of people who can visit this building or just stay near it and it can be dangerous for them if this building is bad. But most people like beautiful and nice houses and buildings, because it is great when there are a lot of fantastic houses around you in streets and it the city. 
The second opinion is about that beauty of buildings that are works of art is more important than producing buildings. In my opinion producing works of art is as necessary as how it look like. Because people who want enjoy, for example, great work of famous architect, really want to feel themselves in safe and be sure that there are not any damage for them and for their children. Nowadays a lot of important buildings are too old and the goverment just get rid of them and make new modern buildings, i think, that it is very bad, because we shold support these works of arts. 
Finally, I think that both these things - producing and beeing beautiful are important and cannot be without each other.

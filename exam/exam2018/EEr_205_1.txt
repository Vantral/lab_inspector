The tables illustrates the correlation between male and female emloyes in Indonesia and Australia during the year of 2010. The talbes cover such sectors as Agriculture, Industry and Services. 
Comparing Indonesia with Australia, we can see that the amount of people working in the sector of agriculture is much higher than the amount of people in other sectors. That may be explained by geographical differences of these two countries. On the other hand, these states shares a crear domination of workers in services. However, in industry the number of engaged women is low in these states. 
In addition, it is important to mention the fact that the Australian female emploees in services are predominant, whereas in Indonesia the quantity of male and female workers are approxamately the same. 
To conclude, the distribution of men and women in Australia and Indonesia flactuates from sector to sector. What is more, we can notice that these countires have a particular interest in the shpere of service.

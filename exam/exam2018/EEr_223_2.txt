Nowadays, there are a lot of different opinions considering the balance between the work and people's free time. Obviously, there are people who dedicate their whole life to their work and prefer to earn more money by spending all their time at work. On the other hand, some people choose to have more of their free time than to have a high salary. 
First of all, I would like to point out that in our modern world people obviously need to earn a goog amount of money to fullfil their wishes, and, more importantly, their needs. So, it it not surprising that people work their fingers off to get a well-paid and socially respectful job. Therefore, they continue to work as hard as they did to save their workplace and to get more and more money. The darkside of that particular kind of lifestyle is that spending too much time at their workplace can negatively affect people's social relationships and even their health. There are a lot of research that prove the correlation between overworking and certain physical and mental ilnesses. 
On the other hand, people who prefer to have more free time usually are more happier. They spend their free time by developing some hobbies or meeting with their friends and families. They are also more relaxed and calm then those who spend more time at their work, and, therefore, their mental health is usually much better. The drawback is that sometimes they tend to become overwhelmed with free time and, consequently, become lazy and lose the motivation to work at all. Besides, they sometomes start to have a lack of money even for some basic needs and that undermines their quality of life. 
Personally, I believe that it is crusual to find and maintain the balance between work and free time in order to be content with both your finances and pesonal life. Evidently, this balance is individual for every human being and it is up to every person to decide what kinf of life they want to have.

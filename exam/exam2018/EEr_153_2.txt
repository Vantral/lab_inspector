It exist opinion that buildings created by architects must to be pleasant to eyes. But there are also other opinion. Some people believe that architects create their buildings according their fantasy. These people convinced that architects no need to think about people opinion because the most important thing is final look of the building. I totally agree that state of view, I believe that the messages and the main idea of buildings is more important than opinion of people who would think that it is probably ugly. 
Several buildings, created, for example, in XIX or XX century, compted as unpleasant. Critics and sitizens compted that it was strange to create that For instance, the Eiffel Tour, created by famous french architect as a participant in the competition in XX century, was an innovation in the world of art because of construction with iron and interesting form. In that time it was not common for people to see something like that, but in the modern world people suggest that the Eiffel tour is the masterpiece of art and architecture. 
Moving forward, buildings can represent the creative idea of autors. The examole to this sentence can be the house in Moscow, which produced in form of the egg. This house located in historical part of the sity and it looks special and non-regular. 
To sum up, I believe that architects should create their buildings in the way the want because all of the art object still relevant even if it is unpleasant for some people.

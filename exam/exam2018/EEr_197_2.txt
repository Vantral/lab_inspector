Some people say that money are more valuable than time while others point out the oposite. They say that the time is the most precious thing and our life and even money cannot outshine it. This essay will discuss 2 different view on this issue. 
First of all, money are that important in our modern world that people are ready to do anything just to get a little. Money are convertable to our dreams and with money you are that sustenable so that you may achieve anything. Moreover, some state that with a little money you are simply unable to enjoy life and all the pleasures there are in the world. For instance, with just a little money you cannot afford to go overseas on vocation. What is more, in the end when you retire you will not be able to enjoy your last days. 
On the other hand, there is nothing to do if you have a lot of money and no time as in the end the life is not about the money it is about the things you do and people you share expirience with. This is what is going to make you a happy person and will make people remember you even after your death. Futhermore, if you are working that hard tryig to earn a fortune it may cause a lot of stress so in the end you may end up with no money, no work, mental breakdown and a lot of time wasted. 
To conclude, I would like to stess the importance of both, money and time and point out the fact that they are so intertvined nowadays. In my opinion, the only way out of this is finding the job you like and enjoying it as only by doing what you like you will not waste your time away.

The given line graph represents the dynamics of fossil fuel consuption in five states of Europe, Asia and America in a period from 1970 until 2015. While it generally decreased in three of them, United States, France and Sweden, it has obviously been growing during almost all the represented period in India and China. 
Actually, their fossil fuel consumption levels were the two lowest ones in 1970: China was at 60% of United States level of that time, while India consumped
a bit more than a half of China. But after that fuel consumption upsurged until approximately 1977 and shallowly decreased until the beggining of 1980's. In contrast, the level of fuel consuption in India saw a steady grow with even
a small fall between 1975 and 1980. However, levels of fuel consumption of these two countries have constantly been generally increasing since than. China became the biggest fossil fuel consumer among the given countries at the maximum of almost 90% of the consumption of US in 1970. While India has reached only almost three quarters of that level by now, speed of growth of its level is generally higher. 
The line graph describing fual consuption in United States is the steadiest. It has decreased only in 15%. In contrast, levels of fuel consumption in France and Sweden plumped in the last quarter of XXth century. Sweden halved its level of consumption (80% of United States level) by the 1990, and France has almost reached such a decrease by the 2015.

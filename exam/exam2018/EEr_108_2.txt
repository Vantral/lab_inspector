The issue of architecture becomes a crucial part of our everyday life as more and more people move to the urban area and the cities are rapidly changing their outlook. In my opinion, it is essential for a building to serve its purpose, although architects should create buildings that are works of art, too. 
First of all, the main goal of an architect is to make our life comfortable and provide facilities that are easy to use. According to this, any building should be designed due to its primary function. There is no point in creating a beautifully decorated parking lot as long as it does not have enough space to park most of the cars in the district. A groomy but well-equiped house with a connection to up-to-date infrastructure is also a better place to live in, comparing with a good-looking but not modern enough one. 
Nevertheless, recent researches have proved that facing objects of art makes people feel happier. Our lifestyle requires emotional stability as any hardworking person should be capable of solving multiple problems. It takes a lot of effort, resulting in the fact that we quickly become tired and frustrating. Enjoying works of art is meant to be one of the most effective ways to reduce stress, that is why being surrounded by beautiful buildings while you are driving home or just walking down the street could definitely have a positive impact on our everyday life. 
To conclude, I would say that these points are worth taking into account by the local government, because they can contribute to redesigning the urban area, making the city both functional and attractive.

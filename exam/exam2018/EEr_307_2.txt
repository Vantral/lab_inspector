Some people believe that the appearence of a building is not that important, it should be practical. Others do not share this position and think that each building schould be produces as a work of art. I would rather agree with the last opinion. 
Buildings should look beautiful and be a kind of an inspiration for people. For example, there are many cities like Rome or Paris with beatuful buildings and, because of this, with great artists. As we know, the fashion inductry takes place in those cities; I can predict, that architecture has influensed this field. 
When architects make a project of their buildings, they should remember that their projects are constructed for many decades. Moreover, people live near those building and in the buildings all the time, they look at them each day. Due to this buildings should not be depressive, architects schould consider the problems of globalization and take care of people who will live in those houses. For instance, in some big cities people in sub-urban districts start to have issues connected with their mantal health because of living in huge houses, which do not have any differences. It is crucial to give people nice housing in cities. 
However, some people have different view on this field. They belive that if every architect consider their building as a work of art, there may be too different buildings which do not match each other. That is why cities will not look good. Despite this idea, there are made some governmantal projects in some cities, which are supposed to predict those problems. For instance, there have been some issues connected with Moscow-City buildings, that is why those bouldings do not take place in the city center. 
To conclude I may say that this topic is controversial, but I would rather support the idea that buildings should be produced as a works of art, so architects should think more about this than about other purposes of a building.

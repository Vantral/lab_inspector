It is known that no one is able to help everyone all over the world, that is why the governments should do all they can to help their citizents. This essay will discuss why I agree with this statement. 
The first reason is that the government of the country know better what their people need. All nations are different and they have divese problems those are special only for their region, mentality and culture. For example, there are lots of discrimination and opression of non-whites in the USA but people do not have such problem in Russia. Russian politics cannot solve this issue or even just give useful advice due to a lack of competence in this social relationship. But Russian government are able to devise some solutions to increase quality of education in Russia because the problem exists in the country. 
The second reason to agree with is that no one country has enough budget to help other people, other countries. Lots of problems to solve need a big amount of money, for instance, wars. If the government from one country want to help another country where there is a civil war, it has to use their own troops to seize and attack the territory and to produce more supplies. Of course, all these meisures need lagre financion to help other country to stop an awful war for the sake of peace. But unfortunaly, most countries do not have such big budget and they cannot even help themselves to solve lots of issues. 
To sum up, it is true that it is hard to give a hand all people and the government should take this mission. I strongly agree with it because if the government cannot help their citizens, I think, people should overthrow them and to choose new who can improve their wellbeing and tackle the problems.

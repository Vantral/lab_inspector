The given line chart illustrates the percentage difference in income between men and women in Japane, the USA, the UK, Germany and New Zealand from 1980 to 1995. 
It is clearly seen that the percentage difference lowered by nearly 10 percent in each country and none of them remained stable. Unlike other countries, Japan experienced a little increase in 1985. On the other hand, the difference in Germany rose slightly in 1995 while the others' percentage was falling down. 
As we can see, the percentage difference in almost all countries was deacreasing slowly but in the USA it was falling rapidly which led to achieving the biggest drop among all results. At the same time, New Zealand seems to demonstrate the smallest decrease. 
All in all, we can say that all five countries show us the tendency to lower of percentage difference in earnings between men and women, even though it was fluctuating a little bit.

Modern cities are fascinating because of the wonderful architecture but there is the point of view that the buildings should only be comfortable in using without looking nice. The other one is that buildings are the form of art and they should be amazing. 
First of all, the architecture brings the cities their spirit. The eclectical Moscow would not be so wonderful without the differences in buildings: the skyscrapers nearby with the houses of the nineteenth century. Secondly, the other purposee of, for exaple, historical buildings is to attract more tourists. The tourists are actually interested in the history of the country, they are ready to pay for all museums and sightseeings, thus it makes profit to the goverment budget. Thirdly, if all of the buildings looked the same, especially in big cities such as Moscow, New York or London, it would be difficult for citizens to live in such depression atmosphere: the same streets, without changes, would be everywhere - in the center of the city or in the regions. 
However, the huge amount of money are spent on renovating the historical buildings. When the country have problems in the medicine or in developing the economical system, it seems to be strange to carry about houses and the external view of the city. Moreover, sometimes it is required to cross our the roads and streets for reconstructing the facades and it causes huge traffic. The third reason is that some modern architects forget about the functions of buildings and they are very hard in using, but their look is fascinating. 
As I believe, the purpose of the buildings is not just a functional one. The cities should keep their history on their streets, help their citizen to feel the spirit which is different in every place on the Earth. 
In the conclusion, the main feature of the architecture is to bring good emotions and positive thoughts to people, as all forms of art. We all need piece of it in our lives that is why cities ought to be wonderful.

Recently there has been a debate on the topic of the purpose of architects. Some people believe that this kind of specialists should not care about the appearance of the building as their main aim is to construct a well structured house, while others disagree with this opinion. This essay agrees with the first point of view. This statement will be supported with the arguments in the following paragraphs. 
To start with, engineers' and architects' first aim is to build a house, not to decorate it. Theese professions are ment to be strictly technical and have practical purpose, though their works can be done aesthetically beautiful. Architects are people who are responsible for real lives of people living in homes built by their projects. 
What is more, there is a wide range of professionals who's job is making art. Designers of any spheres can make a building look great after the most important thing is done by architects and engineers - the house is built and safe to live in it. Then the time comes for art specialists to make the rooms look brighter and cozier, and the front sides of the building more clean and unique. 
Overall, this eassay totally agrees that a new house made by architect should serve a vital purpose of living in it without any danger for human lives. People of art professions (such as designers) will in further steps make a house look greatly beutiful inside and out.

There are lots of discussions on the issue of whether a country should assist other states or concentrate on its own problems only. I believe, that a country should try to help other nations of the world, but only if it does not have urgent and crucial problems of its own. 
From one perspective, almost all the countries of the world are closely linked by political, cultural and trading connections due to globalization. Therefore, the troubles of one country can seriously affect others. For instance, the recent military conflict in Syria has instigated the influx of immigrants into Europoean states, causing such problems as overpopulation, increasing crime rates and so on. So, in order to prevent unwanted incidents in their own countries, governments often have to support other states of the world. 
On the other hand, it is obvious that a government has to solve various issues that can put the economical, political or social stability of its state at risk and can hardly provide any assistance to other countries if, for example, the economy of its own country faces rapid inflation, or there is hunger in the area, or a civil war rages in it. Therefore, in order to help others the state should deal with its own problems first in order not to aggravate the situation. 
All in all, the countries of the modern world are closely connected and sometimes require the assistance of each other; however, I believe that one state should help the other only if it does not have its own issues that need to be dealt with.

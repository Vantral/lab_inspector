Current world is centured on money and entertainment. Due to that fact some people recon that many of us neglect their leasure time in oder to earn more money. Others believe that free time is more significant for people than money. In this essay, I would like to discuss both of the sides on this topic. 
Talking about people, who prefer to have more money, rather than to have a tremendous amount of free time, it well be said, that, obviously, these persons are workhocolics, extremely dedicated ones. They would like to achive as much as they could, but sometimes directly these people are suffering from a huge amount of health problems, deadly desises, mental problems etc. What is more, they can easily lose all of their relationships. For instance, if the person thinks too much about his own interests, literally, centuring on them all of his attention, theresore many people can easily find him a really weird or self-centured person. Actually, it might lead to many unpleasunt consequensies, such as insecurence of themselves and so on. 
However, on the other side, people who prefere only spending their time according to their interests, spending all the money they have earnt earlies, they are obviously too mush into their leasure time. For example, lots of youngers prefer not to waste their time and energy on finding a particular job, they would like to spend the money of their parents or more responsible friends and peers. In this concern, these people are just partying like there is no tomorrow and do not think about their entire life. 
By sort of conclusion, it is quite crucial to emphasize that current world is focused on money and on various ways of spending it. From my personal point of view, i would like to stress that people live only once. If we would be extra-centured on some particular things, we simply would not live our lives on full.

It is commonly believed that buildings should be designed rather for serving its purposes than for bringing aestetic pleasure. Architects are not considered to produce work of arts. I cannot completely agree with this opinion. 
To start with, the raws of typical buildings may influence negatively the emotional state of people. Stone jungles may provoce depression among the city residents. Looking at magnificent city paysages may improve the moral while obresving regularly grey blocks may seriously opress. 
Moreover, architecture has always been a part of a national art, from the Pyramids to the Empire State Building. As well as literature, fine arts and music, it reveals specific national features, which makes it an essential part of national identity. One should not forget that sometimes the purpose of the building is to be beautiful. For instance, medieval churches were often designed to impress people and to show them the absolute power of the Creator. 
Furthermore, great architecture attracts many tourists, which increases the income of the government and, therefore, improves the economy. It also raises the international status of the country. For example, the Eiffel Tower often serves as a symbol of the whole France, as well as the Carlov's bridge is often percepted as a visit card of the Prague. 
In conclusion, I would say that the appearence of the city architecture is very important. It improves morals, attracts tourist and raises the autority of the country. Thus, it is significant for building not only to be useful but also to be stunning.

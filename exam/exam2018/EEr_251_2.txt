The urdanisiation is a growing global tendency and the need to desing and construct new buildings is escalating with it. Therefore, many people believe that image of a building is not to be taken into account and advice architecs to concentrate primarly on the functions of building and neglect the cultural side. However, I cannot fully support this point of view. 
First and foremost, every city has a history and an image and it is duty of every generation to contribute to these aspects. One of the main ways of such contribution developing new desing features for buildings, following the people of previous centuries. Dozens of cities are famous for their outstanding architecture: St. Petersburd, Paris, Venice. The abovelisted cities are associated with works of notable architects. Without the cultural aspect, these cities would be bleak, and this destiny will await all cities, which ignore the place of art in architecture. 
Secondly, people would be less fascinated by the idea of moving into cities, if all buildings were unpleasant to observe. Various serveys were carriend out upon the subject of urbanization in recent years, and apart from the developed infrostructure, the city skyline was named the main reason to move to a city. Consequently, negelecting the view of buildings could lead to decrese in the influx of newcomers, which could become a serious probelms for all cities with an exeption of world capitals, as city managing needs finance to be run and withour citizens there would hardly be finance. 
In conclusion I would like to say, that while buildings need to serve their main function, without proper work on design and producing works of art, cities would experience downward trends in both cultural and financial spheres.

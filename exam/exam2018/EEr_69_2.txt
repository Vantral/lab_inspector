In all times, there is exist a great debate about influence on child's life. It is really controvershial question, thats why the opinion have two sides. 
On the one hand, people think that the biggest influence comes from parents. Because a child was born and grew up in family, where he is always contacts with his father and mother. They lern him how to talk, to eat and walk. Also a child have learn their culture and believs. It is really important for child and his future life. He look at his parents and see persons he would look like. 
On the other hand, there are exist other different parst of society, that can play role in child's development. For example, school and university. There child firsty fased real life, first love and other different things. He learns how to tacle the problems with communication, studies and conflicts. He takes lessons not only about science, but also about life in society. 
From my point of view, both opinions are important. Because they teachs the cild from different sides. Family is more about his human behaviour and his soul. While influence from outside can show him to live in that world and how to communicate with other people. I cannot said, that somthing is more important than other, because in my life my family and school has the same influence on me. 
In conclusion i would like to say that we have not choice and we cannot choose what would be better for child's life. Everyone has their own way in which you choose, what is better for you. Family and influence from outside should "work" together, because only in that way child will lern everything, what he need.

Nowadays more and more people say, that it is more essential for a a building to serve its purpose than to look beautiful. It is true that buildings should be useful rather then pretty, that is why i agree that architects should with this stetement. In this essay i will explain why it is so important for architects to think about buldings" purpose. 
the first thing that should be taken into consideration when producting a house is practicibility. Instead of statysfying people outside, architects should think more about the people inside.

Most art buildings there were seriosly destroyed, while some residential buildings remained untouched thanks for their quakeproof designs. 
In conclusion, i would like to point out again that it is rather essential for buildings to be practicable.

The graph below pertains to a wage gap between men and women's earnings in five countries between 1980 and 1995. 
The highest gender and economic difference was in Japan, with a maximum of 42 percent, which rose till 1985, and then sharply decreased in the course of the next ten years. While the USA had undergone the biggest change as the gap steadfastly dropped from 40 percent to 20 percent in the course of study, while New Zealand had the least of change: a slow decrease of only 8 percent. It should be noted that New Zealand's gap was the least in the beginning of the study. UK's wage gap changed steadily, nevertheless, continously decreasing, as opposed to Germany's: in between 1990 and 1995 the wage gap increased, though for around 2 percent. 
To sum up, the gender gap was being overcome by most countries, albeit with some setbacks (such as the rise in Japan and Germany).

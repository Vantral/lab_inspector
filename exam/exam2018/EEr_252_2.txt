This is a common knowledge that architectural buildings can introduce us with the culture of the country or a city we visit or leave. However, many people believe that it's much more important how these buildings serve their purposes, rather then how it looks like. From my point of view, I suppose that it's possible for nowadays combine these two factors. 
First of all, according to the current century, a century of modern technology
and various developments, it is much easier now to find solution of this issue and invent an universal building, that will be safe and looks like a piece of art. For example, there is an increasing interest and practise of building an eco-friendly houses and apartments in China, Japanese and even in Europe. Such buildings provides people with sufficient safety and comfor, buildings look unique and outstanding, moreover, they positevely afeect our enviromnment. 
Secondly, this is a question of culture values. For centuries, architecture was a part of art, showing unique design features of a particular country. Obviously, appearance had and still have a great value and importance, allowing people, tourists understand citizens interests and what they love and appreciate. 
To sum up I'd like to say that architecture was always a significant part of our history and art,that allows us discover a lot of new and look deeper into knowledge of countries and ancient cities. We can't neglect the way architectures want to express themselves and can't forbid them to do that. Architecture -is an opportunity of remaining of something from us for future, for history.

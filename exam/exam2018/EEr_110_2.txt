Some people say that it is more important for a building to serve its purpose rather than to look beautiful. And some say that architects should not worry about producing buildings that are works of art. Can we say if what they say is right? 
To begin with, surely it is important for anything to serve its purpose starting with casual notebooks and ending with scientific investigations. Buildings are not an exception. Most of the buildings are built for some reason, whether it is to give people a place to dwell or to entertain them with different sort of things such as in circus, in cinema center etc. But it is more pleasant to approach a beautiful building rather than a gloomy and scary one. No one can argue that just beautiful construction without any functions is worse than the one with some services for people. But to my mind, it is possible to find a good balance between the appearance of the building and its functionality. And this is what every human being must try to reach. We live in 21th century and we have a lot more possibilities rather than people that lived ages ago but still managed to create such splendid architecture products. Why should we forget about the appearance of things that we make? 
To sum it up, people always should try to achieve a better result, that is why we are not allowed to let our eyes see awful and ugly buildings even if they work properly.

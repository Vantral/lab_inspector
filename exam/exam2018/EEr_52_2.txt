In our world it is hardly feasible to maintain and support all people, that is why countries need to focus on their own problems. However, how can people not think about others on the planet? I strongly believe that humans should pay attention to each other and facilitate for helping in different situations. There are three reasons to support my point of view. 
First of all, population should always maintain each other in order to have a better contact. Although many countries can have a conflict between them, common troubles will lead to enhancing the relationships, and renovated economic connections will be a consequence of it. It is also possible that people will retreat the perception of a country and then new trading systems will appear, as well as tourism industry will be encouraged. 
Secondly, helping people from different countries is a good way to solve the problem of the pollution of planet. According to many scientists, out planet has been polluted due to human actions: waste, water pollution. That all happens because of bad conditions people live in. While governments can help other countries with poor conditions to reduce pollution, our planet can be cured and saved. 
In addition, the possibily to help humans from all over the world can inspire the power of people's character. This phenomenon should take all population closer together and allow them to get to know each other and to understand the features of foreign cultures and traditions. As a result, with the help of government citizens can be aware of their own country, as well as other countries. 
In conclusion, I should say that nowadays governments definitely should pay attention to the troubles of different countries that will enhance general realtionships between countries and their people.

Some people suppose that buildings should look beautiful and be pleasant to look at, while others consider visual advantages of them inappropriate and needless. 
As far as I think, visual characteristics are inseparable part of architecture. First of all, it attracts people: citizens want to live in a beautiful buildings and enjoy walkings, their rides to home, to work or to univercities. And surrounding view keeps people' mood good and prevents them from depression, sadness and hate to nearby place. For example, almost all cildren are visualists, they love bright shiny things, all items that are easy and plesant to look at. Grown up people are the same: almost all of them enjoy and love presence in good looking place. 
In addition, outside view is must be considered and paid enough money because architecture can be one of the city or country sightseeings, or something for what place is loved by citizens and by tourists as well. For example, people love visitnig Saint-Petersburg, and it always attracts lots of people from all around the world. It happens helps to it's cultural status, and what is more crucial, helps to it's beautiful, breathtaking arcitecture. All people at first look at the overall, common architecture. 
However, some people suppose that paying too much attention to the outside view of building can deprive it from the functional details and practical purpose. They consider buildings must be convinient to live or work in, rather then be pretty. Lots of money is spent on visuality, while it could be spent on elevators, water and heating system, light and other needed for comfortable living supplies. 
In conclusion I would like to point out that visual and practical parts of buildings must be paid attention equally. My point is that beuty is just as important as the other aspects.

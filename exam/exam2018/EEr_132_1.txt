The given line graphs illustrate the amount of energy from fossil fuels in percents in China, the United States, India, France and Sweden in the period from 1970 to 2015. 
In general, there is a trend shown by China and India: these two countries represent almost permanent increase (China - from 60% to 88%, India - from 35 to 73%) of the percentage of energy from fossil fuels, while the United States, France and Sweden have a tendency to a decrease of the amount of this sort of energy. 
It is clear that line, that illustrates the percent of the energy from fossil fuels in the United States is the most stable one: it degrades on 10 percents during the supplied period of time. As is shown, there has been a dramatical degradation of amount of fossil fuels' energy in Sweden from 1980 to 1985. It is obvious that the only country that is likely to make improvements in this economic sphere is India.

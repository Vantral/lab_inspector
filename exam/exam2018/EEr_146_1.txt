The diagram provides the data on the use of energy fossil fuels in China, USA, India, France and Sweden. It also gives the information about the basic trends over the given period (from the year 1970 to the year 2015). The horizontal axis shows the years, while the vertical axis presents the amount of energy in percents. 
To begin with, it is clear that in India the amount of fossil fuels energy has increased considerably and reached a peak of 72% in 2015. The majority of energy was consumed by China (aproximately 88%). This country has also enlarged the percentage of used energy by the year 2015. In contrast, the USA have slightly decreased the fossil fuels energy (from 98% to 84%). In France and in Sweden the level of energy have significantly fall (from 90% to 48% and from 82% to 28% respectively). 
To sum up, the leaders of the use of fossil energy have lost their positions and were replaced by the new ones.

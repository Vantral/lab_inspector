Nowadays it is becomming really popular among population to pay more attention on their work in order to earn more money and do not care about spare time. At the same time, there is a group of people who tend to think more about their free time and do not worry about money. In this essay I will discuss both theese point of views in more detailes. 
On the one hand, I suppose that for majority of us money play essential role in our lives. And it is quite obvious, they allow us to satisfy all our wishes. For instance, in economically develloped countries such as Japane we may see a trend among wokers to spend more time on work place in order to earn enough money for sustanble present and future. They do not think about their leasure time because it does not make any profit for them. 
On the other hand, there is a group of people who prefer enjoy their spare time and pay as victim the amount of money they could earn. For instance, today a lot of young people secrify money and chose jobs which do not require full occupation. As result, they have enormous amount of spare time to waste on their interests or to broad their horisonce. 
To conclude, I would like to point out that the question: what the person should chose a money or a free time is a mixed bag. Different people have different prioroties and everyone should make their own choice that will satify them in life. As for me, I prefer lack of time but a lot of money.

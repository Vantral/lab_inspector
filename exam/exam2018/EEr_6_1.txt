The chart and table below show the percentage of girls and boys who were struggeling obecity in Canada from 1985 to 2005 and the percentage of girls and boys who did regular physical activities in 1990 and 2005. 
By analyzing the chart and table below we can definitely see the increasing in number of overwight and physical active girls and boys through the years. In both tables the percentage of boys is higher than the percentage of girls (except the chart about overweight in 1990 and 1995) due to the difference in complection. 
The comparing of both charts shows that the percantage of overweight girls in 1990 is higher than the persentage of boys so in the table we can see that higher number of boys did regular activity( 57% campare to 51% of girls). On the other hand, it is hard to understand the connection in 2005, where the percentage of boys who were struggeling obecity was higher than girls while percentage of regular activities was the same as in 1990, meaning that percentage of girls was lower than boys's. It means that in 2005 the number of boys in Canada was higher than population of girls.

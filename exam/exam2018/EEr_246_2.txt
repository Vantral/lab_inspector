There is an opinion, that it is not very important to design buildings according to their appearence, and that archetect should think only about the target of this building. This topic is very instrumental nowadays because there are many building processes in different parts of many counrty, and people have this issue about the impotrance of outstending looking. 
I do not agree with following opinion because I strongly sure that pleasant overview of places where we live, work, spend time with our families and friends is crucial for our daily mood. I have some examples, why we should care about architecture in our cities. 
First of all, if we have some problems in our homes we will need to find some solutions in our heads, walking around the house and thinking or going for a work and do it there. It is much more better, that you do it not looking at just grey boring houses but spend this time in bright good looking place. I have one example: once I had the difficult talk with my mother and I decided to go to the city of centre. I walked around those marvellous buildings, looking at shining lamps and big windows, then I turned back to my home having a good mood and stopped to be in sulk. 
Furtermore, the appearance of buildings of our cities is vety important for economics. Myriod of people go to the Moscow to see enchanting architecture of our city. I freely admired, that our government will have very strong issue, if the quantity of tourists begins decrease. There was interesting accident in my life, when my friend from Sweden stoped to thinking about jorney to Moscow just because the Tverskaya Street was bloked and many buildings were with special fabric on their front. 
To sum up, it is necessary to say that it is important solution to change the way of building and government should have a survey about citizens' opinion of this issue.

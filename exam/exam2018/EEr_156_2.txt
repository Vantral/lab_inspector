It is argued by some that architects should build only houses which have practical benefits and it is not necessary to make art objects from them. Personally, I agree with this statement only half, because, in my opinion, the esthetic pleasure also is very important. 
On the one hand, it is a smart idea to produce buildings without special decorates and in minimalism style, because the process of their building would cost cheaper than beautiful ones. There are two main reasons of that. Firstly, to build them fewer workers is needed, consequently, the owner of the land had to pay less money. Another cause is that, in the same time, practice buildings made of not expensive and usual materials. 
On the other hand, buildings with only practice purpose are boring and do not interesting to look at. As a result, is all houses in the city would be without original design, all cities in the whole world would become similarly and ordinary. It can lead that people who live there become depressive and sad. In contrast, if not everyone, but may be one out of five houses would have, for example, bright color of their wall, people would become more happy and optimistic. Moreover, there is a research that provides information that people who enjoys place where they live tend to have longer life than those who hates their homes. 
In addition, beautiful houses with interesting architecture can inspire different people to create something wonderful. 
In conclusion, I prefer building with interesting design to those ones which serve only to practical aims, but latest also have their own advantages.

Nowadays people get satisfaction from different things: money, job, child, etc. People often cannot choose between bigger incomes or more leisure time. As for me people should choose wisely between these two things. 
Many people prefer to work longer, so they can earn more salary. They do not care that they are reducing the time with family, friens or time for hobbies. They believe working longer and harder brings more satisfaction. These people tend to have more luxurious life, but might harm their physical health, as they are sitting for many hours, and mental healts, as they can feel lonely. 
On the other hand, people choose time with family and friends. They see more value in their favourite pastime, prioritizing their hobbies over the big salaries. These people will never feel lonely, as they do not see the meaning of the life in money. They know how to spend their free time creatively with beloved ones. 
In my point of view, people should balance these two things. You can always work hard and gain money. But always have a time with your beloved ones. In case, you die, you cannot bring all of your money with your death, but family and friends will be always there for you even in your last minutes of your lifetime. 
To conclude, they can prefer to earn money, but they should not forget about themselves, as working too much can be harmful for physical and mental health.

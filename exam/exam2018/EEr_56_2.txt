This essay focuses on an essential practical and social issue directly connected to politics and common well-being. To be more precise, this writing is intended to develop an idea of who is responsible for helping people, either goverments or the whole world. 
To begin with, I partially agree with the opinion that country citizens are its responsibility. This seems to be a quite sensible statement. While a person is being born in a country and is raised by it's institutions, knows its' history, has a citizenship, pays regular taxes and is a part of its economical system, the government in its turn has certain obligations towards this person. This is regulated by laws such as constitution. Hence, the law protects a citizen's rights and gurantees certain help and freedom. For instance, in many countries medical help is provided for free. In many others, social pension after retirement gurantees a decent level of life. This seems to be fare while it comes to helping people. 
To continue, along with the first point there exists a slight addition or an aspect of view. There are a vast number of global and local organizations which are intended to provide help to those in trouble, which don't involve support from government. For instance, the Red Cross or public foundations for particular diseases such as cancer. These organizations help people regardless of their nationality or financial status. People participate in these organizations as volunteers and accept any donations and help. This works as a sensible social model, however public foundations constantly lack budget. 
On balance, I suppose that government should take a major role in providing help to people, while being supported by cooperation of humanitarian organizations. Neither of both of these sides should be neglected.

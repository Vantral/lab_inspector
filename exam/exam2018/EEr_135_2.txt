There are a lot of buildings in the world and it is well-known that they are not only stone beasts but also they can be very attractive. So the main thesis is: is it important or not for people if buildings look great or awful. 
In my opinion, it is important for architects to construct buildings for their main purpose: to collect some officies inside and make the safety of people as a priority. For example: the building looks great, it is fashianable but the main problem is that there are no facilities there for people, for officies, for work. So architects should work with people's main needs in buildings and everyone will be glad. 
From the other side the world has already built a lot of pieces of art and buildins are one of them. So maybe it is really important for people to image beautiful shops, houses, officies, schools. Otherwise the world will be sad and grey. For example: when people go to shopping, they want to feel themselves great and safety all together. Beautiful buildings will satesfy them and people will be in a good mood. Also the weather in many cities are cloudly and rainly so it is very often dark outside, that is why people should absorb around them beautiful architecture. 
Thirdly it is important that architects can show the world their great ideas but sometimes it will be better if architects do not build whatever they want because it will be chaos in the word. 
In the conclusion it is important to say that all should be in balance. People should live among beauty and buildings should reflect some ideas of architects or ideas of nation or country. All in all the most important thing is safety and sometimes people can choose and put safety first.

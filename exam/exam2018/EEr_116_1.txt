The graph below provides information about difference between of men's and women's incomes. The graph compares the precentage difference in several countries, including Japan, USA, UK, Germany and New Zeland. 
Definitely, there are two groups of countries on the graph. In Germany and New Zeland the precentage difference in earnings between men and women is much more lower than in USA, UK and Japan. JApan had the highest level of difference in 1980 and New Zeland had the lowest, and these countries saved this result in 1995. 
The graph clearly shows that the overal trend is a fall. The proportion had fallen since 1980 to 1995 in all countries,but the amplitude between the the highest and the lowest percent is diffrent: in USA the amplitude is 20% (from 40% in 1980 to 20% in 1995), when in New Zeland it is approximately 8% (from 20% in 1980 to 12% in 1995). 
To sum up, the graph shows that the precentage in difference between income of men and womehs was not the same between 1980 and 1995, but it is dramaticcaly decreasing for all this time in these five countries.

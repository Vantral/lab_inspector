There is no doubt that childhood is the time when our character and habits develop. Some people believe that atmosphere at home can have an enormous impact on children, while others say that they may be most influenced by external factors. 
Obvioulsy, parents give behaviour patterns to their children and if the family atmosphere is unstable it may affect child's worldview. For example, if a child knows that home violence in natural in his family they may grow up assured that it should be like that. 
On the other hand, there are a lot of situations outside the house where other people may change the way of a child thinking. As we all know, teachers at schools spend a lot of time with children and usually they try to teach them to treat other human beings and animals kindly. Growing up in this kid of atmosphere can lead to change of the way a child looks at unfair relationships between people and mistreating of any kind. 
From my point of view, family does not have that much influence on children as it is claimed, because they tend to spend a lot of time outside the house, communicating with a wide variety of people, who can affect their behaviour in different ways. I wholeheartedly believe that many children and teenagers have family problems and hard relationships with their parents, so they seek support at school and other places. 
Taking into account all mentioned above, I would say that though family may have an impact on children's worldview, the external factors can change it quite as well.

These chart and table demonstrate the amount of overweight children and the children who worked out on a regular basis in Canada between 1985 and 2005. 
It is clear from the bar chart that the percentage of overweight children had been increasing gradually from 1985 to 2005 when the level of obesed children reached its pike (25%). A remarkable feature is that girls used to be generally more overweight than boys before 1995 (12-14% vs 11-12% respectively). On the contrary, boys were obviously more overweight than girls after 1995 (21-25% vs 20-22% respectively). It is worth noticing that in 1995 both genders were equally odesed (16%). 
Turning to the table, it is obvious that the level of exercise had grown significantly within both genders in those 20 years. The percentage of girls who worked out regularly had risen by 26%. Similarly, the amount of physically active boys (that was originally 6% bigger than that of girls) had seen a growth of 30%. 
All in all,there had been a steady rise in children obesity rate in Canada between 1985 and 2005. The level obesity of girls had gone up by 10%, and that of boys - by 24%. In 2005, unlike 1985, boys were more odesed than girls, despite the fact that they tended to work out more during those 20 years. It is fair to say there was no evident correlation between the level of obesity and the amount of exercise.

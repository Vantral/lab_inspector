Architecture is one of the art forms and it is equal in value and significance to all the others. The fact that it also provides for human basic needs does not deprive this way of creativity from its artistic features. 
From personal perspective, in our society culture is strongly connected with architecture. It is impossible to imagine Paris or London without well-known masterpieces, such as Eiffel Tower or Big Ben. These examples, however, may well sound obvious, which is accompanied by the fact that these particular buildings have been purposefully built to be cities' remarkable sights and have never sheltered any people. But the most important thing is that each district of world's famous capitals seems to be created in order to impress tourists and even citizens. 
Furthermore, the architect can never refuse to use creative approach and design simple building lacking in any idea instead of producing magnificent work. This profession cannot be separated from eagerness to bring new bright ideas into the world, as subjects such as history of art and painting are included into every university programme of such faculties. 
In the modern world there are multiple examples of buildings which are environmentally friendly, designed in minimalistic style and impress with stunning view at the same time. The main point is that architectural works can be practical, convenient and represent unconventional artistic approach simultaneously. 
Buildings have to be designed with high taste of skillfull professionals, who are able to implement creative sides in their work and, at the same time, make it suitable for basic needs.

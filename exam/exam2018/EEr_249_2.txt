Nowadays there are hot disputes on architecture purposes. Some people claim that their main role should consists of its main functions, while others concern buildings to be the art. Let us speculate which goal is the most important. 
In my opinion, both purposes are equally meaningful and should not be separeted. I suppose, we can compare the buildings` issue with job`s one: should work bring money or joy. One purpose does not always have to exclude another. 
First of all, no one can argue that buildings` productivity has always been the main reason of their existence. They serve different needs beginning from shelter to a person and finishing with entertainment centres. Also, we should not forget about differnet plants, which have been constructed for making goods. Undoubtedly, every building has its own practical purpose and it is not really crucial what was it. 
On the other hand, we cannot forbid the building to be esthetical. During both architecture and society development, the oppurtinity to create something not only useful but also beautiful appeared. Why would people ignore such a marvelous option? The city landscape is an amazing place for art. It has been scientifically proved that the beauty of the surrounding influences people`s mood greatly. Actually, sometimes simple graffiti can change the building and make the city in general more bright. 
To sum up, I trully believe that the purpose of the building and its outlook do not have to exclude each other. Modern technologies are up to gather both of these factors and create something either useful and beautiful.

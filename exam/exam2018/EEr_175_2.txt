There is a widespread opinion that family plays the most important role in forming a child's personality. However, some people reckon that the outside factors affect you much more. 
I don't think anything has a more profound effect on the personal development than the family. Firstly, the first 3 years of our life we spend almost entirely with our parents, and at that age we might be the most vulnerable and easily influenced. Secondly, friends only start playing an important role in our lives when we become teenagers. Many grownups have plenty of friends from middle school and high school, while most of us don't even remember anyone from primary school. 
On the other hand, some people might argue that at some point children tend to try and grow more independent from their parents, in some cases teenagers even stop talking to them. That's where friends come in, they say. 
But I think that when young people take the opposite direction to the one their parents tell them to, it's actually because of the parents that that happens. If the parents are crazy artists, the rebelling youth might decide to go into a practical field such as economics, and if the parents are boring mathematicians their child is likely to turn around and join a theatre troop. 
So, even if friends do start playing an important role in a person's life at some point, young people are still majorly affected by what their parents are and what they want them to be.

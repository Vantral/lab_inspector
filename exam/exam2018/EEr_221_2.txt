Nowadays, earning a lot of money has become an important tendency or even just a need. People spend all their life trying to have more and more money without any rest while others have more deep outlook on life and prefer having more free time and less money because our life is too short. 
Earning a lot of money is not so bad, but it can lead to different adverse consequences. First of all, problems with your health is inevitable part because lack of sleep, fast food or stress everywhere can lead not only to deppression or headaches, but also to cancer, allergy and insomnia, so it's crucial to understand this concept. Secondly, a person who doesn't see anything but only his work and money, will miss a lot of opportunities in his real life concerning love, friendship or even travelling. In other words, a man wil not see our wonderful world or doesn't feel deep love, and so what? what is the purpose of his life? just material things? 
However, having a lot of money is a huge privilege in our modern world. Futhermore, a person can be a workoholic and it is a good way to express himself through his work. Additionally, money is a key to almost everything you want, talking about material things. For instance, if you want to go to Maldives or diving or attend a concert of your favourite group, or buy jeans from Armani you can just pay money and that's all. 
In my opinion money and a lot of work will not make you happy. If you have the best clothes and a huge flat but you aren't an interesting person and can't support the conversation with people or even don't have time on life, it will be a disaster. 
To sum up, people forget about simple things. It is better to have more free time and do what makes you feel happy and special than just devote all your free time working and earning money.

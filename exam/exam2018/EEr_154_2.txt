Should buildings be beautiful or sensible? Some people say, that serving a purpouse is a main goal of building, while others argue that buildings are works of art and their appearance values. In this essay I will try to illuminate both views and join one of the sides. 
Those who claim that buildings have to be considered as works of art, argue that houses, skycrapers and blocks of flats are things those we see every day, especially in big cities. They should be at least pleasant to look at. Otherwise it can be very uncomfortable to exist in urban spaces which are filled with only typical monotone and boring buildings. It can cause social as well as psychic problems for the people who live there. In addition, the whole amount of city buildings produce its special spirit, and it is very important for it to feel comfortable and attractive both for citizens and tourists. 
Other people are more concerned with practical needs. They believe that works of art cost much and there is no opportunity to build as many such buildings as it is needed for all the citizens. Therefore it is better to build more cheeper and less attractive buildings in order to give places to live for all the people in the city. 
Moreover, art is a personal deal while the buildings are for many people. Some can dislike the thing that others consider beautiful, and it is unethical to violate personal tastes. 
Personally, I agree with ones who stand for artificial value of buildings. Statistic shows us, that in areas with ugly and old buildings crime rate is mugh higher than in those with ones meant to be works of art. That means, appearance of the building affects wealth of the neigbourhood, and good surroundings can protect someones life. This is a point which should not be missed.

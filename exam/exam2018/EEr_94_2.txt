There is a point of view that a building should only fulfil its practical purpose, while beauty is irrelevant in architecture. I cannot fully agree with such a statement; although I am not competent enough in this area, I tend to believe that there are different fields in producing buildings, each serving for different aims. At times beauty is as important as any other feature of a building. 
Firstly, in my opinion, architecture should be considered an art to the same extent as painting or music should be. In each sphere there is pure fine art and more down-to-earth parts: for example, along with concert symphonies there are musical compositions produced for advertising which are more practical for marketing than aesthetic. The same situation can be observed in architecture. Some buildings are primarily created for beauty and then find their function in the city structure; others are produced just for practical purposes. 
Moreover, there are museums, art galleries, and other buildings which are masterpieces themselves and for which their appearance plays an important role. Attractive objects draw attention, form the overall impression of the city, and can in general be more popular than plain gray buildings. In this case beauty and rationality work together. 
And finally, I believe that there is no building that cannot serve any purpose at all, if it is produced carefully and follows the rules of architecture. Those who work in this field should therefore stick to the original idea, and any object would eventually find its function. 
All things considered, beauty should not be underestimated in architecture; some buildings can be pieces of art and for some their appearance can even be called crucial although they also serve practical purposes. Many, on the other hand, are created just for rational goals. Personally, I believe that architects should only bear in mind what the original aim of their work is: whether it is aesthetics or rationality.

The tables below list the percentage of male and female workers in three employment sectors such as agriculture,industry and services, in Indonesia and Australia in 2010. 
Overall,it is demonstrated that the most common and popular employment sphere for both genders in Indonesia and Australia was services sector. It is clearly seen from the tables,that the vast majority (more than a half) of men and women chose different services instead of working in agruculture or industry. 
As it is illustrated, in Australia 32 per cent of male wokers were working in industry sector,while the number of female workers was only 11 per cent. Consequently, it can be said that the percentage of man working in Australian indusry was considerably higher that the percentage of woman working in tha same sector. 
Another trend in this table shows us that in Indonesia the amount of people of both sexes choosing industry was the lowest. The approxiamate percentage of male and female workers was almost 15 per cent for males and 8 per cent for females,however in agriculture it is seen about 50 per cent of people. By observing this table, it is obvious that services sector achived the highest numbers, that is why it could be summed up that industry was the least popular employment sector among female and male workers.

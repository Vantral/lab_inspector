This line chart shows us a persentage of the energy from fossil in five different countries from 1970 till 2015. Here we can see five lines which shows us how did the persentage changed in this 45 years. 
We have two coutries which persentage encrease significantlly. In 1970 China had only 60 persent of energy from fossil and in 2015 it peaked to 90 persent. India is raised too from 35 persent to 73. 
Three countries decrease dramatically for this 45 years. From 90 persent France fell down to 48 persent and Sweden from 83 persent decrease to 25. Sweden reached the valley. 
United States lost not so many persent as the previous two countries. From the peak above 95 persent it went down to 83. 
In 2015 three coutries have good results in persentage of the energy from fossil. China, United States and India have more then 70 persent when two countries like Sweden and France have less than fifty persent.

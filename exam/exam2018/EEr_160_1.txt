Charts below represent the differencies between people who attend three courses in a UK college. People were divided in three age groups: first is 18-25 year olds, second is 26-40 and third is 40+ years old. Number of students listening these courses is almost equal - it fluctuates from 600 to 650, but there are interesting differencies in the percentage of groups which I would like to compare. 
Big part of listeners the science courses consists of 18-25 year olds students - it is 55%, then it is 30% of 26-40 year olds and the least part is people older than 40. On the opposite, Arts courses seem to be more interesting for old people - it is quite big number of 45% that consists of 40+. Finally students from 26 to 40 more often choose Sports and Health courses, it is 62% of 630 students. 
A closer look at the data shows, that it is art course that has approximately equal parts of all age groups, while other courses have more specialisation in the age of listeners.

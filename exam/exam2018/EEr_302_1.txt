The given line graph depicts how different is the income of male and female emploees in Japan, the USA, the UK, Germany and New Zealand and how did the situation change in 1980-1995. The vertical axis indicates percentage, the horizontal axis indicates time. 
In Japan the difference accounts for up to 40 percent in 1980 and that is the biggest amount. However, the percentage plummeted after a slight increase in 1985 and in 1995 stopped at number 30. Furthermore, in all countries the percentage difference in 1995 is substantially smaller than in 1985. In all the cases exept for Germany it supposedly keeps falling, although in Germany it started rising. 
In 1995 the best conditions are presented in New Zealand since the percentage difference there accounts for the smallest amount - slightly more than 10 percent. Some lines intersect, showing that, for instance, the situation which was in New Zealand in 1980 was only achieved in Germany somewhere near 1983 and was not achieved in other countries at all. Only one country has never shown groth in this difference - the USA. The line in the grath nosedives and even though in 1990 the decline is slightly inhibited, it does not end. 
All things considered, there is stable improvement in the destribution of money, however, the situation is not ideal and keeps changing.

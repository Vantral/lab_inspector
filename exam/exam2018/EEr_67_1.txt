The chart given in the task shows us the percentage of overweight youngsters in Canada from 1985 to 2005. 
It can be pointed out that in the beginning of the research, in 1985 the percentage of the girls was higher that the boys one. Surprisingly, the tables have turned, and in 2005 the percentage of overweight boys was higher than the girls one by 3 percent. It is interesting to underline that in 1995 the percentages of boys and girls were the same - 16%. 
On the other hand, we have the table showing us the percentage of youngsters who did physical exercises on regular bases in 1990 and 2005. In the first year of the research girls and boys had only 6 percent difference, whereas in 2005 the difference has grown up to 10 percent with boys in the lead in both years. If we compare 1990 and 2005, the nubmers of boys and girls have increased by approximately 30 percent. 
I should point out that the percentage of overweight youngsters and youngsters who did physical activity increased simultaniously.

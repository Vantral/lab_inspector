The graph presented below shows the amount of energy from fossil fuels of five countries around the world: China, United States, India, France and Sweden. Time period of the graph equals 45 years. 
As can be seen from the graph there are two main tendencies. The first one is gradual increasing of percentage, and lines of China and India follow this tendency. In China the amount of energy from fossil fuels have increased since 1970 from 60% to almost 90% and reached its maximum in 2011. China's point in 2015 is slightly lower. That means the tendency of increasing is probably about to change. Line of India is almost parallel to China's but with lower numbers: percentage of energy has raised there from 35 to approximately 73% in 45 years, but in 2015 it has its maximum and will possibly continue increasing. 
The second tendency is declining, and lines of three countries including United Stated, France and Sweden are going this way. There are some differences, though. While the amount of energy in United States is decreasing rather slowly (from approximately 95% to 85% in 45 years) then the ones of Sweden and France experienced a rapid fall in a period from 1975 to 1986: they both lost 30% of their whole amount in 10 years only. 
In general, most of countries presented on the graph tend to decline their amount of energy from fossil fuels. Developed countries as Sweden, France and United States follow this tendention with only slight changes, China is going to join them and for developing India this is only in the future.

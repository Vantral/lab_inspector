The graph below presents us the information about the difference in income depending on sex in five countries: Japan, USA, the UK, Germany and New Zealand. 
To begin with, let us describe the situation in general. During the period of 1980 - 1995 the difference in income between man and women has become less significant in all of the countries mentioned above. The biggest difference is in Japan, where men earned up to 40% more than women in 1980, and this difference had decreased to 30% by 1995. The leader of gender equality here is New Zealand, if we only mention 1980 and 1995. In 1980 this difference was only 20% and the situation still improved - in 1995 this difference was just a little bit above 10%. 
Now I think that we should highlight some interesting tendencies. The best improvement was made in the US. If we look at 1980, the difference between male and female income was almost as huge as in Japan. However, in 1995 it was cut by half. The UK does not show any rapid change of difference in earnings between men and women, but the situation is becoming better. 
The situation with New Zealand is a little bit ambiguous. Even though New Zealand was a democratic leader in terms of income in 1980 and 1995, Germany was showing some better results in between. 
All in all, we can see an overall tendency of salary difference decrease. This means that democracy is developing and giving people of both sexes the same amount of rights and opportunities.

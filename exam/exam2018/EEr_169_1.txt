The three pie charts give information about the age of science, arts and sports and health courses students in a UK college in 2012. The total number of students varies - 650 in science courses, 600 in arts and 630 in sports and health. The results are given for three age groups - the youngest participants (18 to 25 years), students between 26 and 40 and the elder contestants - over 40 years old. 
In every course there is always a dominating age group. Even more crutial is, that it is always a different one - the age group between 18 and 25 had the most participants in science courses - 55%. The middle age group - from 26 to 40 - was the largest in sports and health - 62%. And 45% arts students were from the elder group(over 40). 
Overall we can see two groups with significantly less participants. There were only 15% science courses attenders over 40 and also only 15% under 25 sports and health students. The absolute record is the number of sport and health student in the age group 26-40. The most diverse courses - with the least difference between the age groups - are the art courses. The difference between 45%, 25% and 30% is relatively insignificant.

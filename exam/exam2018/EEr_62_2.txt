In our hectic times people have to overcome a lot of problems in various spheres of our life or, at least, alleviate their consequenses. Reputedly, it is unfeasible to help everyone, so political rulers should be involved solely into their countries' lives instead of striving for happiness of every single person in the world. In terms of this I partially agree with this opinion, so let us examine the problem more carefully. 
In the first place, it is obvious that governments cannot help everyone while they face their own problems. To begin with, to tackle any problem means to invest a lot of money while a country's budget is always limited. To illustrate this example, one can consider delevoping countries that do not have enough money even to solve their own problems and for them it is extremely irrational to spend it on other countries' issues. Moreover, such countries do not usually boast elaborated political systems, so it would be hard for them to find ways to solve more vital problems than those ones they have. 
Nontheless, there are also countries that have enough resourses to be used to improve many people's lives. It should be mentioned that nowadays many countries are perceived to be prominent leaders due to their economic and political stability. They are able to invest in deprived countries' future and such actions can affect all the people on our planet. Furthemore, it goes without saying that cooperation among thriving countries will be beneficial for all humanity since withount spending a lot of money each country will contribute to overall happiness. 
All things considered, I presume that it is a contentious issue and one can hardly find a definite answer. What is clear for me is that governments should not ignore the problems that countries have across-the-board and assist them if they are able to.

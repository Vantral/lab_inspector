The world is changing, but people do not stop to undertake appropriate measures not to leave people under adverse conditions. Unfortunately, governments cannot help all people in the world because of many causes and they should focus only on helping the inhabitants of their countries. In my opinion, the authorities should spend time and finances to develop their own countries. 
First of all, the governments spend a great amount of money to provide many poor countries with food, water and usefull equipment and do not sort out finance for their own needs . Moreover, nowadays many scientists cannot device new things or make immensly important and vital breakthrougs because they are not given an appropriate budjet from the government. For example, Russia helps Syrian troops with guns and other weapons to take part in the gross and hostile war and the inhabitatnts of this country has many important problems such as low qualification of scientists. 
Moreover, some countries can forget about their inhabitants and give all facilities to poor one. Nowadays, the governments provide a great number of countries with electricity or oil and leave their people with out these facilities. For example, some years ago Azerbaijan turned off all electricity stations in many towns to help poor countries to servive, but, unfortunately, azerbaijanian people lived with out light, Internet, TV for 4 days. 
To conclude, it is feasible to help all contries but this action lead to some problems for example with science or has a negative impact on living conditions of inhabitants.

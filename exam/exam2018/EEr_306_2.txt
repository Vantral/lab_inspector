Some people suppose, that the beauty of the buildings as a purpose for a architects does not matter, or, maybe, even should not exist. Other type of people consider the buildings as a pieces of art and show their interesting in how different projects looks like. I know a lot of reasons to not put in the first plan the attractiveness of the buildings. Oftenly, they are about practic side: if we talk about local area, which is being transformed into a place for living, it is khown by everyone, that in this case architects may take seriosly factors like the geografical conditions, how big or small the territory is, needs of future habitants, their own skills, so, it is not a crative task, the objective is to create a comfortable and functionable place with a nessesary infrastructure for certain group of people. It needs to be serveble, it does not contain the unbelieveble beauty or originality in the plan. It has to be tipical, and quiete simple. The other argument is that the beauty is, like "in the eyes of behavior", the same building can be considered the ugliest the more faboulous and handsome building in the town or even in the wourld. The magnificent example of this is the Eiffel tower - being the simbolic part of Paris is in same time as a disattractive, ugly, unfunctionable and strange construction for dozens of people. 
In other way, people are thinking about art a lot and can fina somethihg aehstetic in very different parts of life. The buildings and other objects in architecture are turned in pieces of art, because people need to live with a beauty. How can we explain the books about the most attractive buildings? The second argument is that the well-being of every persen and conditions of living, including the beauty, are connected. So, I think, that beauty does matter.

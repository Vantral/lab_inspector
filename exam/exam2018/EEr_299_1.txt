The line graph provides information on the changes of salary diffrences of men and women during fifteen years in Japan, the USA, the UK, Germany and New Zeland. 
The percentage of compared earnings in New Zeland in 1980 was the lowest among the released results - only twenty per cent, at the same time the data from Japan showed fourty per cent of difference. Japan reached the peak in 1985, having more than fourty per cent but after it the number went down and dropped to 30 per cent in decade. 
Germany reached the minimum shown on the graph data. In 1990 the differences in earnings between men and women were insignificant, only ten per cent, but during next five years it increased gradually to almost 12 per cent. 
The data from the USA shows us the dramatic decrease of this percentage: in 1995 it became double less than in 1980. This is the rapidest fall illustrated on the graph. 
In the UK the fall of this number was gradual, almost on 13 per sent, as it can be noticed from the graph. 
In conclusion, the obvious tendency wass decreasing the differences in incomes between men and women. It can be explained by the feminists whos actions are dedicated to destraction of gender preferences in all spheres of life.

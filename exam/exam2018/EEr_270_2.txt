Today there is a great debate among architects what is more important for a building: its appearance or its purpose. Personally, I think that, of course, the purpose of a building is crucial thing to consider before production, but arcitechts should not forget about its look and it is as well important as the aim of a building and is worth worriyng about. 
In my opinion, buildings are what form a city, a town or a village. That is why it is extremely important for architects to design them in a proper way, because that is what the whole place depends on. A building should not be an eye-sore, but an attraction and something eye-pleasant to make residents as well as any visitors to a place feel happy and excited from seeing a building. Moreover, the wealth and general development of a place depends on the arcitecture a lot. For example, no one can be excited living in an area surrounded by ugly and dull buildings, such as factories, for instance. Plus, tourists surely won't be encouraged to visit such a place, while beautiful buildings catch tourists' attention and interest for sure, and tourism is imporatant because it can bring a lot of money to an area. 
However, many people believe the purpose of a building is more important than its attractiveness, because they believe the beauty does not count if a building gets a real profit by serving its purpose. 
Overall, I am convinced that the beatiful image of a bulding is no less important than the real purpose, because a beatiful buuilding can also be a source of getting benefit, and, as we all know, many popular spots all over the world got their fame due its unique architecture.

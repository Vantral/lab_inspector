In fast-moving word it is really hard to deny the necessity of having a lot of money. But for reaching this goal,there is nothing way exept for working more and more,reducing your private time. The question is quite rethorical: What should people do earn more money for bright,but limited free time or to live life without such opportunities like rich people have. Some people believe that money is not so important as we could think so,whereas the others do insist that without money, it will be really hard to enjoy life fully. 
Those,who support that it not necessary to limitate free time to live happily,insist that the best things that can appear in your life is mental. It is all about the feelings:when you spend your daily evenings with your family and friends,fall in love,get married or have a child-for all this things you do not have to pay money,only emotions. Thinking in that case, you can understand the wealth of being loved. 
At the same time,we cannot ignore the fact that money is the mechanism for gaining what you want. A lot of people can support the naive idea of "importance of living with your lover,no matter where" destroys,when you strart to understand that you cannot deal with all difficulties only with love. For a lot of them you have to have money. You cannot recovery from illness only with love. You need a medicine and for this you have to pay. And in general,it is easy to have wonderful moments of your life due to the money you have. 
In my opinion, almost all depends on a person. For my believes,I would work more and have less time rather than rely on something abstract. I honesly do not see the impact of having a lot of free time,because in that case you will not appreciate that you have,it will be just your daily routine. But for my life,i want to have more bright and remarcable moments, that is what I choose.

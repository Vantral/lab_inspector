Nowadays many people think that the building should rather serve its purpose than be beautiful, and architects must not create buildings that people would like to look at. In this essay I will try to explain why I completely disagree with this opinion. 
First of all, I think that people would more likely buy the apartments or work in the building they like. If there is something special in how the building looks, people will remember it, and when they will need to buy a new apartment, they may think about this building. What is more, the flat in the building like that will cost more that the flat in the usual building. So beautiful buildings can help governments and architects themselves make more money. Talking about the building that is work of art as a workplace, this may also encourage peolpe to work there. Even if someone does not like his or her job, he may go there just because of the way the building looks like. 
Secondly, if architects like what they are doing, they will do a better job constructing this building and people will be safer in it. When an architect is producing just a usual building, he or she may get bored while doing it, which may cause some bad consequences. For example, he or she may get so tired that he or she will forget to make a bathroom in one of the apartments. It will be impossible to sell this apartment, and even if someone will buy it, they will feel really bad. What is more, an architect may make a fatal mistake when he or she is bored, and many people will die because of it. On the other hand, when an architect is doing the really beautiful building, he or she will never get tired or bored because he or she really likes it. 
To sum up, I totally disagree with the stated opinion because, firstly, beautiful buildings may cause people to buy the apartment or work in there, and, moreover, architects will like producing it so they will not make any terrible mistake.

In this day and age, many countries face with some extremely unplesant problems, which need to be solved in order to help its citizens. Is there a need to help other countries, insted of focusing only on your own people in your country? I completely agree that the government should focus mainly on its citizens and make it a priority. In this essay I will try to prove my point of view. 
To begin with, I should mention the budget of the country itself. Everything depends on the money and how well can the government operate with it. For instance, the governments need to spend money on social needs, security, medical centres, infrastructure and so on in order to help their people to live in better conditions, to provide citizens the best they can give. If those money will go to the other people in the world, there is a chance that there can be the lack of facilities and opportunities for the people in their own countries. 
Another point, is that if the country's government only concentrates on helping other people all over the world, they might forget the prior focus - their people. Country will only help those, who they think need a help, not remembering the problems, which accure in their own mother land. The problems will only gain bigger and, as a result, whill cause catastrophic consequences. It can be also an example of demonstration to other countries, that exactly this country can help the needy one, as they want to have an approval from others. 
To sum up everything that was mentioned above, I still stick to the point that it is rather impossible for country to help everyone else in the whole wide word, as there can be so much problems in the country, which need to be prioritized and solved.

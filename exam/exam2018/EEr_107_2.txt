With the threat of overpopulation and the rise of ocean levels due to global warming the architectural value as both creation of beautiful buildings and a pragmatic science of building houses is re-evaluated. The most radical idea on the pragmatic side of the spectrum is to disband the artistic practice altogether and focus on providing only the housing and recreational areas. In this essay I will argue on whether this change is required or whether art serves a certain purpose in the creator and in the society. 
Firstly, architecture as an art is a way to both house certain social structures, whether it is families or factories, and shape sociological conditions, as argued by Richard Sennett and Richard J Williams in their respective works. Furthermore, the structure devoid of the aesthetic fails to influence the mind of the onlooker so they would strive for beauty and progress, which can have potential damaging effects on the society as a whole. 
Secondly, architecture is a means of expression for people who are not interested in becoming craftsmen of any other kind: jewellers, musicians, sculptors or artists. With the loss of the craft would come a loss of the artistic in themselves, which would result in disastrous concequences. As sociologists argue, creation and creativity are not only the most important features of the human mind, but are necessary components for a healthy and full existence. Thus art should be explored accordingly in all shapes and forms. 
To sum up, architecture should serve both an aesthetic and the pragmatic purpose, pleasing the eye or shocking the viewer and, at the same time, adressing the spacial needs of humanity.

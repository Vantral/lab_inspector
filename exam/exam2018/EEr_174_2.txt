It is a fact that there are many factors influencing a child's development and character. The question arises which factor is the most vital for the normal future life. While some people claim family to have the most important influence, others argue that outdoors communication plays a more significant part in forming child's character. 
I personally stick to an opinion that family is the most crucial factor. Initially, friends and other people outside the family take no responsibility for the child - everything he or she does under their influence will not affect them in any way. In contrast, parents are responsible for their son or daughter, so they are obliged to try their best in raising a child. Furthermore, outside of a home, children mostly communicate with their peers or more rarely older adolescents, not adults. It means that younger generation is usually unlikely to get wise advice outside the family. 
On the other hand, it can be argued that parental advice can be outdated and that children need to learn how to communicate with their age group, because this skill is important for future life. This is a statement that cannot be argued but family members still should have an influence on children - at least, in order to teach them how to manage so-called peer pressure and not to suffer from excessive peer influence - i.e. to be able to consider critically what they hear. 
Overall, family influence is the most important factor for child's normal development, because the parents are only people how take responsibility of it.

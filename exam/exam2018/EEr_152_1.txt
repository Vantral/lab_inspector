The line graph demonstrates how much energy has been produced from fossil fuels in five countries, namely China, Sweden, India, United States and France during the 45-year period from 1970 to 2015. The indexes are given in percent. 
From the graph is clear that the two European countries have taken measures to decrease the usage of energy from fossil fuels. Although America tends to have sinked it by the year 2015, the process have gone gradually, in contrast to the two countries. Sweden takes the first place in ecological terms due to the fact that fossil fuels have become not significant energy source during the 45-year period. The percentage of usage of such an energy decreased dramatically between 1970 and 1985 from 82 to 45 percent with small and short increase in the late 70s. After 1985 energy production from fossil fuels sinked gradually and then remained almost the same, including some fluctuations and finally reached 25 percent. France has had the similar trend, the sharp reduction in getting energy from fuels continued until 1985 too and stood at 61 percent. United States have decreased the index from about 97 to 83 percent during the whole period. China is one of the countries with negative trend, due to the reason that the role of fossil fuels there has risen. By the year 1978 the production of energy increased from 60 to 70 percent and then started to rise gradually and reached 88 percent by the end of the period. 
From the graph is obvious that France, Sweden and America have aimed to introduce more alternative energy sources, while other countries tend to have difficulties with the realization of it.

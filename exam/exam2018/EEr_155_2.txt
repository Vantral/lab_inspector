There is an opinion saying that buildings should serve their purpose at first place, while looking beautiful is optional. I cannot fully agree with this statement, as the exterior of any building seems quite an important issue for me. 
Firstly, it should be mentioned that producing good looking constructions develop the process of smart urbanisation. Erecting some poorly designed buildings may worsen the atmosphere of the city, which can affect directly on the citizens. This can subsequence the fact that nobody would like to live in that place, thus make it prosper in every way possible. 
Secondly, creating some aesthetically extraordinare buildings might attract tourists. For example, Eiffel Tour brings a fantastic income to the municipal institutions and to France in general. It is considered to be a number one destination for everybody visiting Europe. 
Nevertheless, it must be stressed, that the financial source is important too. The cost of the project should be adequate to the amount of money, that citizens are able to donate via taxes. If the population is poor, the direct purpose of the building should be put in the first place, while some extra decorations or a breathetaking design should be managed afterwards. 
To emphasise all abovementioned it should be said, that buildings must totally be a work of art to the extent that it can be afordable for the citizens. Not only living in a beautiful city raises the quality of life and brings joy into it, it also is a very good source of income if treated properly.

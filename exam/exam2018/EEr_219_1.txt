The given tables illustrate the ammount of men and women workers in differnt employment sectors in Indonesia and Australia in 2010. It can be seen that the percentage of people in both contries is completely differ in each sector. 
Looking at the Indonesia's situation, we can see that the biggest difference with the Australia's one is in the percentage of workers in agriculture. Only 1% of women are working in this sector in Australia, whereas in Indonesia - 43%. On the other hand, the industry sector is almost the same in both countries. The percentage differ from 8 to 11. 
On the other hand, the situation with men in both countries has no visual similarities. For example, there is twice bigger ammount of workers in industry sector in Australia then in Indonesia. Moreover, in agriculture only 3% of male workers are likely to work in Australia, when there are 29% of men working in this sector in Undonesia. However, the main feature in both countries is that male workers are mostly common to work in services sectors rather then in agriculture or industry. 
Overall, this countries have different percentage in male and female workers, probably because of the different economical situation in both.

Nowadays, with huge increasing of cities by building a lot of modern houses, the question about mainstreams in archetecture become more and more difficult to ask. My opinion is that every building should comply both functions: good loking and serving it's own role. 
Initially, all buildings are fisical object, which are regarded to the forces of nature, for example gravitation, so they should be proected by people who are quallified with knowlege of mathematic and phisic. For example the Eyfel Tower at the begining was thinked as an art object only, but it was builded as a tower and eventually it becomes a building with it's own funcionality. 
In conclusion I want to restate my point of view, all architects creating building should keep in mind not only the look of the building, but also it's function.

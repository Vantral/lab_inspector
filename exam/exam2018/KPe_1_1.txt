The pie charts illustrate data about proportions of goods (such as machinery, metals, food, non-metallic minerals, chemicals, and manufactured goods) transported in Eastern Europe by roads or by rail in 2008. Overall, what stands out from the charts is that while the most popular goods transported by railway were metals, roads were used for maing predominantely food products. Another interested point is that manufactured goods were transported by roads slightly more than by rail. It also can be seen that whereas machinery goods were moved more via railroads, non-metallic minerals were transported mostly via roads. Looking at the details, it is noticeable that metals were transported by rail more than three times as much as by road (35% and 11% respectively), whereas roads were used for transportation of non-metallic minerals twice as much as the railway (13% and 6% respectively). Manufactured goods were moved by both these types of transport in a similar proportion (28% for roads and 25% for railway). As regards the food products, for their transportation were predominantely used roads, while railway moved an insignificant percentage of this type of goods.

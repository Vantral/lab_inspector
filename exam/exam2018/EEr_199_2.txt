Nowadays a lot of people desire to have a high salary as money is one of the most important factors of determining well-being or even success. Money gives you opportunities, hence everybody wants to have enough money. Nevertheless, to get money you have to work, that is why some people prefer to earn more money sacrifizing their free time, while for others their free time is more important than getting much money. 
On the one hand, the more money you have the more opportunities you gain. Consequently, you have to work harder to get your money. If it is the main purpose of your life and if you are satisfied with this rythm of life, so why not? You will have collegues at your work, so you will not be cut out of the socialization process or even of the world. People get used to any conditions, and in this case good money are a benefit as you will be able to live in luxurious conditions and then retire and have a plenty of free time. 
On the other hand, working too much when you are young you can miss your life. People have to meet with friends, to make families and raise children. But all these perposes need much free time. Concequently, people have to spend less time at work and, as a result, get less money. But they are the happy ones as they have enough time almost for everything and are not under stress because of their 24 hour work. 
All in all, I would like to state again that it is up to everyone to choose which position to take: to have more money or free time. As for me, I would definately choose the situation when I could have not a plenty of money, but a plenty of friends and time for myself as we cannot return the past. And not to be disappointed in future because we are lonely we need to spend more time on people around us right now.

Childhood is a really important part in a humans life, because then he gets his main characteristics and habits for the rest of his life. But who is the main sourse of influence on child development? Let us speculate upon this problem. 
Some peolple are sure that only familly can effectively show direction of the child's way throu his life. They might say that the longest time children spend and home, so parents have the most influence on them. Also their parents are the first peple in a children's life and olny they by the law have a ritgh by to deside what will be the best for a child. 
Opponents disagree and suggest that anoter factors may play the bigger role. Their main argumet is that there are a lot of people grown in a not really good famillies becomed great persons. Moreover many children from nice famillies connected with bad companies and ended petty. 
All in all this issue will forever remain debatable. As for me, I belive that everything is important and for normal child's develoment.

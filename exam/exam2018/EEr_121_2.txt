Some people argue that architects should not worry about building designs being primitive, their prodcut should be good as buildings, not art. Personally, I do not share this opinion and strongly believe that the scenery that buildings make up has a huge impact on our mental well-being, and this fact cannot be ignored. 
Firstly, due to the process of urbanisation, more and more people see nothing but buildings around them everyday. People by nature seek for beauty, that is why products of architects' work should meet this humans' need and look fascinating. For example, it is well-known that an image of an item affects our way of thinking about it: we make conlusions according to the feelings the image awakens. Further more, positive emotions, regarding one particular thing, can boost our mood. People would be more satisfied with life, if there was more which would amaze us with its beauty. 
What is more, We get most of the information through the visual source of perception, i.e. from our eyes. Why not build something which takes your breath away and make benefits from it? The science of marketing has already come up with some hooks, aimed to attract people's attention. Even if pedestrians and car drivers just pass a building by, they get a certain idea of what the brand is like only according to the way their building looks like. 
Finally, architecture is considered to be art, and architects have always been known to compete by creating world-known masterpieces. Product of their work does not only serve nowadays pupposes, it also reflects current state of art which will be our future generations heritage. 
To summarise, I do not agree with the idea that buildings should be build for the sake of being useful as a sort of a container, not for the sake of being a piece of art. I believe that society does not want architecture to loose its art propeties.

There are 650 students of different age. 55% of the total amount of students at the age of 18-25 years old attend Science courses. A fewer percentage -- 30% of students who are at the age of 26-40 and the smallest group, only 15% of people who are 40 years old and above are interested in Science courses. 
The amount of people attending Arts courses is smaller, than the amount of Science courses and it has 600 students. 
The smallest group of students are about 26-40 years old and make 25% of the total amount of people. 30% of students between 18 and 25 years old attend Arts courses. The biggest amount of students attending these classes, which is about 45%, is taken by the people who are 40 years old and above. 
The last chart shows that people from 26 till 40 years old are interested in Sports and Health courses more than two other groups. 62% of 26-40 years old people, to 23% of people who are 40 years old, and only 15% of the younger generation from 18-25 years olds.

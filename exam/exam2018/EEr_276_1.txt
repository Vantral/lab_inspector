These pipe charts illustrate the number of students in three programmes in the UK University in 2012, people are divided to the groups based on their age. There are science, arts and sports courses and the amount of students on each is approximately the same. 
The amount of students who are 40 years old and above in the arts courses three times more than in the science courses, aged people preferred this programme more than others. By the way, there is an opposite tendence with young people, their number are the largest at the science courses and the smallest in the sports and health courses. Additionally, students of the health and sports course are mostly middle-aged. 
There is one pattern, that there is no programme with similar number of participants, they are not divided equally. In each course there is one dominated group of students and two smaller ones. For example, in the first pipe chart the group of young students dominated, in the second aged people were the biggest share and in the third middle-aged people have the highest number.

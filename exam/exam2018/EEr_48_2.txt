People nowadays are still arguing about whether it is possible or not to help people all around the world. Some people claim that there is a feasibility to help all nations, the others, however, think that the governments should support only the citizens of their countries. To my mind, the rulers should help not only their dwellers but people from other countries as well and in this essay I want to provide two arguments to support my opinion. 
There are a number of reasons in favour of global assistance. To start with, it is
a well-known fact that not all countries are equally-developed. There are still a lot of countries of the third world existed on Earth that are in need of support from the other side. Not paying attention to other countries and concentrating only on yours can lead to horrible consequences like famines, citizen wars and etc. Furthermore, most of the times the troubles that people have to face are the fault of the government. And when affecting it does not change the situation the only way is to get help from the governers of other countries. 
Another argument for helping people all around the world is saving the reputation. 
If the ruler does not give assistance to undeveloped countries or countries that are in great need of help due to other circumstances, it can create an adverse
image not only of the government of the country but of the whole country itself. 
Consequently, due to bad reputation if the country is in trouble the rulers of other countries will not going to provide aid. 
Taking everything into consideration, it can be concluded that, helping citizens all around the world is a matter of great importance, because being indifferent to others now may have a negative influence on both the country that needs help and your country itself.

Many new buildings of different shapes and colors were build up in the past decade. That fact caused heated debates - wheather buildings, first of all, shoul be useful and serve its purpose or it is a necessisty for arcitects to construct modern building that are works of art. I agree with the first opinion. From my point of view, it is far significant for buildings to be useful than just beautiful. 
Some people sure that buildings should serve its purpose and only then the question of the beauty should appear, they have several reasons for such statement: during the construction of buildings the issue of the safety should be the primary for the architects. Definately, architects should contribute to stop any kind of incidents or even acidents during the exploitation of their buildings. Moreover, it is not always comfortable to work and especially live in buildings that were not constructed to serve the purpose but to be innovative and spectacular. 
However, there are people who believe that all modern cities nedd to be a works of art - with complex and interesting shape and colors. Thought, it is necessary to make colorfil buildings that catch everyone's attention. They claim that in that way we can help the economy of the country by having tourist's attention to our cities. 
All in all, I am sure that in the construction of buildings the ability to serve its purpose should be primary issue and the way it looks - secondary.

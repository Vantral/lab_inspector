Moreover, the overall number of people working in agriculture in Australia accounts for 4%, and the number of those in Indonesia is 72%, what is around 18 times more. However, the percentage of men working in agriculture in Indonesia is roughly 10 times as much as those in Australia while the percentage of women employed in Indonesia in the same sphere is 43 times more than of those in Australia. It is important to mention that female workers in industry comprise approximately a half of male workers in Indonesia whereas Australian female workers make up just under a third of male ones.

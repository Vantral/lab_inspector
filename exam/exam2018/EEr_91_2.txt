The three pie charts represent the information about people`s attendance in a UK college in 2012 according to their age. Each pie chart shows a certain type of activities (Science courses, Art courses, Sports and Health courses) and the data in each of it are divided into 3 age groups (1 - from 18 to 25, 2 - from 26 to 40, 3 - from 40 and above). 
Overall, in total there were around 600 people who attended each course section of the college. It can be also clearly seen from the graphs that there always was an age group which representatives showed the main attendance in a particular type of courses, and the other two groups of people had practically the same indicators of attendance. 
In 2012, the absolute majority of students (55%) who attended science courses were the young people from 18 to 25 years old. The percentage of adults who visited this kind of courses was 30%, while the proportion of the elder attendants of such type of classes was twice smaller than the previously mentioned age group (only 15%). 
The majority of people who preferred art courses was represented by people of the third age group (45%), whilst the other two groups had practically the similar proportions (30% and 25%). As it can be obviously inderstood from the third pie chart, the absolute majority of the people who chose sport and health courses as their educational activities was shown by the representatives of the second age groups (62%). The difference between the proportion of the attendance of two other groups was only 8%.

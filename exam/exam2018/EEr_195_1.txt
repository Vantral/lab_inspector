The presented tables demonstrate the percentage of both female and male employees in three employment sectors of Indonesia and Australia in 2010. 
According to the tables, the biggest proportion of employement was given to representatives of the service sector in two countries at the same period of time. Nevertheless, the number of female candidates from Australia was approximately twice as many as the number of female workers in Indonesia. Contrariwise, the number of male workers stayed the same in both countries and fluctuated from 56 to 65 per cent for this particular sector of employement. 
Furthermore, the tables show that the agricultural sector in Indonesia was also in demand among workers of two genders, whereas the same sphere of employement in Austrial was not popular among employees at all and took only 4 per cent of the total number of workers in this country. Besides, the number of men interested in Industry in Indonesia was twice as much as the number of women wanted to work in the same employement area. At the same time, the percentage of male workers in Australian Industrial sphear was three times as many as the number of female representatives. 
Overall, taking the data presented in both charts into consideration, it is important to mention that the total number of women and men looking for the work in two countries stayed almost the same. However, the biggest number of female workers in Austria and Indonesia in 2010 worked mainly in the sphere of service, whereas the male representatives of these two countries were equally interested in industrial employement sphere as well.

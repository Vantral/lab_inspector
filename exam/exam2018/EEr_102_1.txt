The graph provides the information about the difference in earnings between people of different genders in Japan, USA, UK, Germany and New Zeland. The data represents the period from 1980 to 1995. 
This graph shows us a clear distinction between countries: Germany and New Zeland have much smaller difference in men's and women's incomes - 10-22% compared to other countries' 20-40%. There is an overall decline in persantage for all five countries during the presented period of time: the difference in earnings dropped for about 10% in average. USA shows the most decrease of 20%, while Japan seems to have the highest percentage during all 15 years: starting at 40% and dropping only to 30% in 1995. 
Althought there is a clear tendency of men and women getting paid more equally, their earnings were significantly different in 1995 even in some of the most progressive countries like Germany, New Zeland and United Kingdom.

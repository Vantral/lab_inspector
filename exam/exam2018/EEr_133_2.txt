In my opinion to serve purpose of buildings more important than them to look beautiful. In our days have many different buildings, many of them look really beautiful and impressive, but they means nothing, Only beauty,unfortunetily. Architects should worry about producing buildings, because it is very important for them, who knows, maybe exactly his building will member of culture or museum. In comparison people think different, many believe that buildings need us only for beauty and make city more interesting. They do not need that buildings give us purpose. In the other hand, people, who like art think that to serve purpose very important for city or nation and our future kids. Many buildings, who stay museums helps people to save the histore of country or town. I would like that in my native city was more and more buildings, who save purpose.

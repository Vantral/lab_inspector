The pie charts compare data on the age of students attending different courses of a UK college in the year 2012. 
By looking at three charts, one may notice a strong correlation between the type of courses and the age of the majority of attendants. Science courses are interesting mostly to the younger people of age 18-25 years. This group builds up more than a half of the courses' auditory. Middle-age group of 26-40 years is presented two time as big as the older ones who are 40 years old and above. As for the Arts courses, 45% of students are of the older age category. 26-40 years olders show the least interest in arts content, just a quarter of students may be affilated to this age group. Almost a third part of the auditory of Arts courses consists of young students. At the same time, people of age between 18 and 25 years are not so involved in Sports and Healts courses. Only 15% of students are these young. The oldest of attendants are also not so extensively presented, their number may be measured as almost a quarter of those who attend these courses. Middle-agers are respectively constituate the biggest proportion of 62% of students. 
To summarize, the graphs shows that the age of students affects their interests. Youngsters' major interest is science, those of middle age predominantly work on sports and health and mostly older people chooose arts to learn in the college.

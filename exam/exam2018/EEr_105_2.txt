Some people think that it is important for buildings to be visually pleasing, while other people believe that it is more important for a building to serve its purpose and to be secure. 
On the one hand, I believe, that buildings should be built with their purpose in mind. They should be planned so it would be comfortable for people to live or work there. When buildings are not built for the organisation that they are later used for there could be some problems. For example, there is a hospital near my house which used to be a palace in the 19th century. While it looks beautiful, in order to get from one doctor to another, patients sometimes need to go to different buildings of the palace. In cold Russian weather it is unpractical, because they can become even more ill. I think, that if the hospital was built from scratch, there would not be such problems, because it could be built as a one building. Also, apart of overall practicality, I believe that a building should be secure and sturdy. It also should be as fireproof as possible. Therefore, decorations made with flammable materials should not be used for buildings, where there can be a lot of people. 
On the other hand, when every building in town is built only with it's purpose in mind, it looks liveless and boring. It can be bad for mental health to live or work in such a place. Therefore, it is important for buildings to look nice and pleasing. 
To conclude, while I do believe that practicality and safety of the buildings should be a priority, architects should not forget about aestethics.

Nowadays Internet gives us a lot of opportunities. Some of them are watching films, listening to music, and usually we prefer doing it free, not buying official copies. Some people claim that it is like crime and there should be punishment to this actions. In my opinion, it is right position. 
First of all, people who distribute illegal copies have versions of films or songs of bad quality. Due to this fact impressions from these products can be worse than after using official versions. 
Secondly, "pirates" break the law because they haven't got rights on these products. 
Thirdly, it is wrong that musicians and film producers lose their money, which they can earn while doing their job. When we watch film or listen to song, we are consumers. We have to pay as for food or clothes. 
Other people can say that it is not so huge amount of money because people who have such kind of profession have good salary. Of course, if one person download illegal copy of film it will not be a huge harm, but I think that everybody wherever do something like that and not at once. Overall, if we try to calculate how much we could pay for each film or song we can see a great amount of money. 
To sum up, I agree that people who distribute via Internet illegal copies of music and cinema industries' products break the law and should be punished.

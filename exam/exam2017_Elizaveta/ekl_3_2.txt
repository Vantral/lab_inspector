We live in the century of modern technology and free access to the Worldwide Web. Every person can easily download any information, including films and music. In this composition, there are heated debates about punishing people, who download illegal pirate copies. Personally, I strongly believe that such "pirates" are not crime-makers, and have some certain undisputable arguments, which I describe below. 
First and foremost, the Internet is a free platform, where people can get in touch and share information with each other. So, to my mind, the authorities are not able to follow our "movements" in the Internet (we live in a democratic society). More than that, in my opinion, the "media thief" is a person, who steal a media content (music, films, books, etc.) and download it into the Web for other users. To my mind, such people should be punished. 
Nevertheless, there are staunch defenders of the directly opposite point of view. According to their opinion, musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year because of illegal pirate copies. They think that people who do not buy the original CDs but download media from the Internet should be punished. I can not fully agree with this statement. In my opinion, musicians and movie-makers should be more responsible for their own stuff and take different measures to protect it. 
To sum it up, I should admit that both opinions might be right. However, I strongly believe that people who download the media content should not be punished. As I have already told, the government should punish a real media thiefs, and, at the same time, producers should take care of their music and films.

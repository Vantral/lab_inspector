It is a well-known fact that nowdays the internet piracy became a major issue of concern for an entertainment and cutural industry. While trying to find a solution, some would claim that such illegal activity should be severely punished and restricted, when others would insist that a situation can be radically changed by the industry adopting to this new conditions. If you ask me, I support the second position and this essay is to explain why. 
First of all, it is not always easy to get an access to the certain content legally. For instance, there might be not a comfortable digital commercial resource linked to a music album or a film, while offline shops, selling the product you are looking for, would be located far away. The Internet solves the problem of distance. In fact, if you would use any popular services, like 'Apple music' or 'Steam', you would not only decrease a chanse of your work being pirated, but also gain new customers. 
Others would debate that the development of online means of commercial does not decline the system of bans, fines or other punishment. The industry could regulate market trough this push-pull mechanism, puniching crime and rewarding following the rules. 
While still respecting this point of view, I can not fully agree with it. I find the existing ways of illegal content monitoring highly ineffective. Especially in the context of fast darkweb and torrents evolution. The piracy became too strong tendency and too techicaly developed to be stopped that easily. 
In conclusion, the cultural industry would have to find a new way to adopt and to remain profitable in the fast changing conditions of the internet piracy.

Nowadays the Internet is situated probably in each flat or house and users begin to use it from little age, ant it's not a secret that we can find anything we want there, especially music or films. The problem of copying and sharing them is widespread and serious, as producing these products costs a lot, sometimes too much, but users don't pay for it, they don't progress such spheres. 
In my opinion, illegal pirate copies is a great illness of economic sphere in music or film producing. The results some day could be awful. First of all, nowadays any business or creative work need money for progressing and innovating new views of art, and when people don't pay for creative work this work could be stopped or begin to regress. Secondly, a lot of musicians or film makers aren't rich, sometimes poor, but they want to create, but how can they create or live, when they don't get money for their work? Thirdly, enormous money are going not to the creators, but to the pirate web sites where we can find films or music by great number of recomending goods and things. It's not moral when people get money because of the websites with films or music, while these musicians or film produsers don't get. 
However, some people think that illegal copies make our lives more happy and easier, doing what we want, when we want and where we want. 
Taking into account contrarguments introduced above, I strongly belive that the results of such look at the live will punish us. 
To sum up, I think that pirate copies should be deleted, all humans who are in this illness system punished, and all creators who do their work well get benefits, their own benefits.

The author's rights and illegal copying became a huge problem nowadays. With an invention of internet and its usage all over the world we have access to many films and music, but some people think that downloading them online is a theft. Personaly, I think that people should be punished for buying pirate copies. 
First of all, there is a certain law that determins buying or spreading pirate copies as illegal. It is made for protection of author's rights, because writing music or making films is their job and by buying the original discs we paying them their salaries. Whereas, if illegal copy is down loaded, musicians and film producers will not be paid. Moreover, fans of a musician or a filmmaker show their support by buying original copies and this can help artists to develop. 
On the other hand, some people believe that they must not pay for something if they can get it for free. Also, they do not think that this is a theft because they do not take any material object, but just down load some files from the Internet. I do not agree with that because it is the same as do not pay you employers for their job and just expluatate them as slaves.

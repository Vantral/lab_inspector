Music and film industrias are developing nowadays in an extreme rapid. Companies spend a lot of money on producing cultural goods such as movies, music and similar supplements. Making a quality products demands huge amount of resours as well as money and time. So the producers want to cover cost spending on production. 
Some people believe that it would be a good decision to make all video and audio products free. First of all, all groups of people including the poor and uneducated will have an access to downloading the products. In terms of education it would have a great contribution to expansion of outlook and enlightment for common people who can't afford buying music and films. Secondly, the person can easily download any product he likes without using extra devices. 
Moreover, it can be done for one click and doesn't demant much time to download to your device. 
On the other hand, as I've said before the fim and music makers wants to cover cost and get some benefits for their efforts and hard work. But there are such people who break the low and copy original products for their own profits. So, it can be called a "theft" to some extent. The cultural products are the property of their owners and only they can decide whether the products will be sold or given for free to the customers. Therefore some kind of punishment may be introduced such as a fine or penalty. 
To conclude, downloading cultural products for free may be a good way of education for common people, but there is another side of this case. Film and audio makers don't have to carry loss for their hard work and get some profits, so I think copying and sharing music and films must be confined to some extent and be punished.

Some people argue that musicians and movie-makers lose loads of money annually due to illegal downloading. They also claim that those who prefer downloading files from the Internet instead of buying original ones should be punished. This essay agrees with the statement because any little crime is still a crime. 
It is undubitable that almost everyone has ever downloaded something from the Internet illegally. This happens because regulations about loading files are not coherent enough or people are just unaware of them. Anyway, there are laws that prohibit distribution of files loading illegally, and everyone who breaks the law should take their punishments. They might be not strict like small fees, but thieves should be asked to pay them in order to keep the world in secure. 
Another thing is a great lost of money that musicians and producers experience. While recording a song or making a movie, artists and corporations have big expences in staff, machines and advirtisement. Therefore, they need to get some profit when the product is released in order to stay at the market. Millions of pirates on the Internet contribute to the reduction of the producer's income downloading and distributing files in the network. 
To conclude, I am convinced that if we want a world full of good citizens who do not break laws, policy should take care of all online crimes.

In the recent years there has been the significant increase in the amount of music and the number of films avaliable for the free download by millions of internet users around the world. The fact that the artist lose their well-deserved money due to the illegal distribution of their works is highly upsetting and makes me believe that those who don't purchase the original disks with music and films ought to be punished. 
Firstly, the more people download the illegal pirate copies of the original disks, the greater number of these pirate copies will be made in future, thus, the less is the possibility to prevent this illegal industry from prospering even more, replacing the original discs of music and films. It is crucial to punish the people buying the illegal files from the internet in order to decrease their willingness to use these pirate copies, as none of them will be eager to face the consequences of such an illegal action. 
Secondly, while downloading illegal pirate copies instead of bying the original disks, people not only take the money away from the musicias and the film producers, but also help those thieves, who copy and share these files. Due to the tendency of prefering the illegal files to the original ones provides those who make the copies with more ways of copying and sharing pirate copies and more money for these illegal actions, while the creators of the content suffer financially. Those creating the art should not be disrespected in such a way and deserve the money for the amount of work they have done and the amount of effort they have made.

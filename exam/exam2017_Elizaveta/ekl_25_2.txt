Nowadays, there are many illegal pirat copies around the world wich leads to decrease of huge amount of money and lost of a big part of income of many musicians and film producers. I agree with the idea that connects with the punishing of people who copying and sharing music or films free. 
Firstly, so many songs and films can be used in diffrent ways by people who want to earn money for themselfs. I think, it's not a good way of buisness. Because you just use the works of other people and the popularity of some talented and great artists. Moreover, I think that it's a wrong way of downloading films and musics, because in this way you make the hardworking of money people unusefull. I mean that a really big amount of people and the team of professionals work under the good product. And finally, you just use it, listening it or watching without any payment. I think it's really bad. 
Secondly, I believe that punishing of such illegal actions can lead to the decreasing of some strange situations when other people change the music and make it the own product. I agree that illegal downloading makes the way of listening your favourite songs or watching the good film easier. And it is really helpfull for those people who don't have any money but want to be the part of the fans or the culture. Unfortunately, all of that don't let people use the work, talent of other people. 
Overall, I think that authorities should punishe people who use music and film in illegal ways. Moreover, they should looking after that and create several laws, may be. And finally, authorities must decrease the payed for the CDs, DVDs and so on.

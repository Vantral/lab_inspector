In the modern world an access to every piece of information is becoming easier. There are a lot of books, films and songs that have a certain author, but avalible without any fee on the internet. The problem is that it is hard to find the source of sharind or uploading. I agree that copying and sharing certain files is theft, but I disagree that people downloading them deserve punishment. 
Firstly, the person that downloads music or films just uses an opportunity to save files to they computer. If there are no ability to download selected files the ordinary person will never do that. According to me, people that upload and share information like films and music should be penalized, and the punishment should be in money, as that foe's are cousing economical problems for authors of music or films that illegaly shared on the internet. 
Secondly, I believe that any person should have an opportunity to try any kind of product that costs money. Consequently, the developers and producers of films and music as well as clothes or food should give a chance to experience the using of their work. That's why a lot of people downloading music or movies are just curious and willing to try the product. Moreover, to avoid illegal downloads authors should upload a sample of their work on the internet so people could have ability to check whether they like it and want to buy or not. 
To sum up, the uploading, copying and sharing specific files on the internet is illegal and should be punished, but people downloading these files are just curious and do not deserve the penalty, even though, they deserve to try the things that cost money for them.

In current times, the huge amount of internet users illegally share the information, including the products of musical and cinema spheres. My point of view is that such people break rules and, consequently, they deserve to be punished, although it is hard to find them. 
First of all, copying and sharing music or films without rights for this actions is equal to theft. In comparison with a stealing of an art object from the museum collection, it is obvious that police will try to find the burglar. But it is really difficult to point to the one person, sharing files in the web. That is why it is an expensive and time-waisted process. 
In addition to this, it is highly arguable question whether we need to find the person to punish, who downloaded the file at the first place, or collect the list of all people shared this information to label them as copyright breakers. 
All in all, it is a long process of punishing internet users for sharing information, as they can't know the rules. Nevertheless, they need to be punished in accordance with the country laws.

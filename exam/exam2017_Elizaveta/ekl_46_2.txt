In recent years the tendency of sharing numerous illegal pirate copies of various films and music albums have been observed. Someone assumes that people who provide this kind of stealing as well as those who thanksfully consume it should be punished. Others truly believe in another solution for such damaging for mucisians and film producers tendency. Personally, I am sure that criminalization of such activities will not help to music and film creators to earn back amounts of money they loose year by year. 
Firstly, it should be noted that the Internet was created to share and distribute information. Of course, there is a difference between buying a legal product and taking a stealed one. However, in majority of situations people contribute in pirates' job only when there is no other choice. For instance, a student who is not being payed well can not allow themselves to waste money on buying a documentary film which could be necessary for theirs education, so consuming an illigal copy is the best solution. Moreover, the wild distribution of illigal films and music albums made it easy to use them while buying legal ones can be impossible due to the language or technological barier. 
On the other hand, sharing illegal product does affect economy, so special measures to eliminate such trend have to be taken. In contrast to the common opinion, I do not think that consumers and distributors of such copies should be punished. As for me, it would be more logical to make the process of buying legal products easier. For example, the goverment could open more local cinemas, especially in the countrisides or clubs where such things as films and music can be presented in the legal form, stopping citizens from having no other choices rather than consuming it illegally. 
To conclude, I would like to say that copying and sharing illegal culture products is the serious issue, but criminalization will not solve it successfully.

Nowadays, in contemporary world of new modern technologies people have more sources, that give them opportunity to download music and films for free. That is the issue for producers, who lose money, but at the same time it is a very good advantage for people, who can not afford themselves to buy CD. In my opinion, downloading or copying films and music is not a crime. 
First of all, illegal pirate copies help people to save money, because they don't need to spend it in the cinema. Moreover, adolescents who don't have a job can just download music on their smartphones insted of buying discs. For example, there are many apps, which includes music, videos and films, which people can listen or see for free. Secondly, people don't have time to go to the cinema, or to the shop to buy a CD disc, that is one more advantage of illegal copies. Users just download the choosen film and can watch it any time. For example, when people are getting in the traffic jam they can watch movie or listen to music on their Ipads, phones or laptops. Last but not least, often illegal pirate copies are downloading on the Internet faster than leggal one's, that's gives people opportunity to watch films before they see reviews or spoilers. For example, the data release of some movies in America or Europe is earlier than in Russia for more than a month. That means in news people can see some interesting information about the movie, so they won't be interested to see it. That's why people download illegal copies, they just can watch it with the rest of the world at the same time. 
In conclusion, I believe that there is more advantages than disadvantages of illegal pirate copies. It makes people's life easier, cheapier and faster and earlier than official release.

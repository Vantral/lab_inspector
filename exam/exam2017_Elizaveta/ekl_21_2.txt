Nowadays, there are a lot of opportunities to take information, data, files, music from the Internet. The vast majority of Internet users use it almost everyday. Modern person can watch film or listen to music he or she likes. I believe, such opportuinity schould not be punished and websites with files have to be opened for all. 
First of all, the overwhelming majority of Internet users is students or workers, who spend a lot of time for studing or working. In order to this fact the majority of people prefer to download files as they have no opportunity to visit cinema or concerts or special shops. Moreover, download file don't take a lot space as discs with music or films do. It is very comfortable for bussy people to have extra stuff in flat or house, as it can infuence on concentration, punctaition and order in the house. 
Secondly, sometimes it is very expensive to perchase discs, as there are a lot of musicians and types of films today, and person can has a lot of interests. For example, if student is interested in comedy films, rock music, he/she has to buy a lot of discs, moreover, often students have to watch some scientific films for education and it is disohenst to take money for basic education. Additionally, people are eager to try something new, and to try a new ganre of music they schould spend a lot of money, while people can just download files from Internet for free. Thus it is irrational to demand to buy original discs and punish people for downloading free samples. 
Modern technologies allow as to download files for free and learn new information about art and people themselves. Internet users can take a lot of benefits of downloading, for example, saving money. Thus I strongly belief that nobody schould be punished for listening non original music or downloading different films.

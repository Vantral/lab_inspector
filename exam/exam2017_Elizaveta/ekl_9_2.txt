In our modern world pirates becomes an essential part of our life. Musicians and film producers have a huge damage from them. Earlier pirates did not be so widespeard but now because of modern technology, such as Internet, it becomes a significant problem for entertainment industry. From my point of view, it is not a good idea to punish the pirates themselves and people, who download these files illegally but in reality it seems like utopia because it is difficult to catch these people. Also I can imagine that all of us at once download these files from the Internet instead of buying them. 
To begin with, some humans do not have enough money to buy legal copies. They could understand that it out of bounderies of morality and it will be better if they buy a legal copy but their salary does not provide this opportunity for them. Many people in our country spend almost all salary on fees and necessary things. More than that, if necessary files can be found in free accept, all people decide to download them, instead of buying the originals. I think, it is a feature of our phychology and we will download illegal pirate copies in the future. 
Nevertheless, some people believe that musicians and producers lose huge amount of money from pirates. As I know, their income are rather high and losing some millions not a significant problem for them. Record and film labels have contact, providing some benefits for them. They decrease the consequances from pirates. 
To sum up, I want to say that music and films should be available for everyone. The entertainment industry always has been orienting to people and even if they can not buy legal copies, they should have a chance to get it illegally and donot be punished.

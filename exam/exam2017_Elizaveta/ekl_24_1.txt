The bar chart gives data on the percentage of unemployed people in different world regions in 2014 and 2015. It is clear that there are no drastic changes in the unemployment rate in these regions troughout the given period of time with North Africa being the region with the highest unemployment rate in the world. 
It can be seen from the chart that there are two regions demonstrating neither rise nor decrease in the percentage of unemployed citizens. North Africa stays the region with the greatest number of unemployed people with the unemployment rate accounting for 12,5 percent in both 2014 and 2015, while the unemployment rate in South Asia accounts for 3,9 percent, making it the region with the least number of citizens having no occupation. It is also remarkable that the overall unemployment rate in the world is the same in 2014 and 2015, accounting for 5,9 percent. 
As far as regions with the noticable changes in the unemployment rate are concerned, it safe to say that there are some downward trends, as well as the upward one. Thus Midde East and Latin America face the drop in the unemployment rate in 2015 with the percentage of unemployed people there accounting for 9,6 and 5,8, respectively, while the numbers for 2014 are 11 and 6,8 percent. There is also a slight change in the unemployment rate in the countries of the EU, with the percentage of unemployed people there growing from 7,5 to 7,9 percent.

Howadays, the Internet and technologies play a vital role in our everyday life and influence different spheres of it in a numerous ways. In particular, it allows people to download illegal pirate copies of numerous films and music albums without purchaising it. This fact leads to immense loses of revenue by musicians and film-makers. Therefore, I suppose that users who practise abovementioned illegal actions should be punished in order to solve this problem. 
First of all, the process of creating music tracks and films is quite complicated and it requires a large amount of resources, both human and material. What I mean by this, in order to produce a quality movie lots of efforts are neccessary. For instance, the production of a typical action movie includes a large number of essential stages such as the plot development, working on special effects, actors' performance, computer editing and many others. Hence, it can be considered a hard work and have to be rewarded in the right way. 
Second, film and music industries are not just business but arguably can be a form of art. Thus, I'm inclined to think the creation of pieces of art should be encouraged. However, downloading pirate copies significantly reduces revenues of producers and music bands which causes their lose of motivation and enthusiasm. It can be examplified by the fact that a waste number of musicians in their interviews complain about illegal theft of the albums and some measures have been already taken to prevent this and to support mucisians in their future work. 
To sum up, I suppose that illegal downloading of mucis and films lead to negative consequence for the development of respective industries. This issue should be analysed and measures to prevent the further problems should be implied: people who take part in theft have to be punished and needless conditions for produsers should be provided.

Music and film business is very widespread and popular nowadays. But there are a great amount of examples of copying films and producer's creatings by the dishonest people with future promotion of it. I agree that such actions are a kind of crime and people who share other's private music of films should be punished. 
Firstly, people who copy producer's films and musics prohibit the norms of own-creating and as a thefts, steal another people's ideas and unique creatings. That is the first point why those "film and music pirates" should be punished. There are several norms and laws, which are implemented in cinemas to reduce the amount of pirate copies, for example, viewers should enter the cinema without video-gadgets. 
Secondly, film and music pirates should be punished because of the selling of stolen film/music copies. Producer's business lose a significant sum of money from every pirates share/copy. As a result, "cinema thefts" make their own business on making copies of original discs of musicians, singers, actors. For example, there are a great amount of pirate shops in Russia, where they sell downloaded versions of films/music on "origin-view" discs and take a prise for them close to the producers'. Some actions are done by the government to prevent the "pirate business", but it is still widespreaded. 
To sum up, I agree with the extent that people who copy producer's films and musics should be punished because such pirate sharing reduce the amount of money, which producers could have from the creatings and prohibit the norms of private-ownings.

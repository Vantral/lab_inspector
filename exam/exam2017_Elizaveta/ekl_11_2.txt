Nowadays, a growing number of people are tend to listen to music and watch films in the ways that are different from the legal ones, including copying and sharing files in the internet instead of spending money on the original sources, such as discs and web-sites. Consequently, art creators lose great amounts of money with every illegal pirate copy. My opinion on this situation is that downloading free media files can not be restricted at all and in what follows two arguments will be given to support this point. 
First, there are a lot of people who do not have enough money for buying official films and soundtracks and are unable to buy content on discs and on the internet. Therefore, a great number of people will not be capable of buying and consuming the content they like and, hence, they will not have an ability to enjoy their time and ever develop. Furthermore, official content costs a lot, for instance, a single album or movie can reach 10 dollars or even higher in price. So, lots of people will look for alternative ways of spreading the content in case of restrictions on pirate copies, which may lead to even more serious breaks of authorship. 
Second, there are still a lot of people who is fond of buying official films and songs as they consider that the quality of official content is better than of the illegal one and people also are ready to spend money on good films and songs. Therefore, producers and musicians have a great revenue not only from their content sold officially, but also from participating in festivals, giving interviews and advertising goods. 
Finally, people should have an opportunity to download files for free and they should not be punished for that. Content creators may imply various marketing strategies in their planning in order to increase their revenue if they are willing to.

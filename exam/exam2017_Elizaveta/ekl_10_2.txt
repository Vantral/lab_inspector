Nowadays there is a significant problem with illegal making and using pirate copies of different movies and songs. Every year movie makers, singers and musicians lose a lot of money because of that. I believe that people who make these copies and those, who download them should be punished. 
First of all, film and music producers spend a lot of time for making a final product for costumers. Some of them also have graduated at the universities, and that's why their work has to be payed. 
Moreover, I think that goverment has to has to make a project, which will help to promote and to show how the work of artists, producers and others is hard and important. People should understand that and stop using pirate copies instead of original ones. On the other hand, sometimes original discs cost too much, and people are unable to buy them. For example, in Russia it is really expensive always to buy original versions of different movies or songs. The solitary is lower than in Europe or in the USA, but, anyway, I believe that there are some ways to solve this problem. All we need is a goverment support, which is in producing different social advertising or creating a project of making taxes lower. 
So, I am of opinion that a problem with illegal pirate copies has to be solved by making a cost of original discs lower and by punishing those, who will be still using free versions.

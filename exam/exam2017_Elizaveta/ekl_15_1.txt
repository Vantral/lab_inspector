There is a chart in front of us which shows changes in unemployment rate in two-year period. On the horizontal axis there are the selected world regions and on the vertical axis there is a percentage of unemployment rate in these areas. 
The main tendency in this chart is that the rate is equal in 2014 and 2015 or it is getting lower. Thus, there are two regions where we can see no changes during the period - North Africa and South Asia. Also we can see that in North Africa there is the highest level of rate and in the South Asia it is the lowest. In Middle East and Latin America this level is getting lower but this change is not getting bigger than two percent. However, the situation in EU is quite different because the level of unemployment rate is rising there. 
Overall, there is no change in worldwide situation.

The bar chart contains information about percentage of people who do not have a job across the world in 2014 and 2015. 
It can be seen that number of unemployed people varies in different parts of the world. The highest unemployment rate is in Africa - it is 12,5% to be exact, in both years. The runner-up is the Midde East with 11% of all people having no job in 2014, although is decreased in 2015 more than by 2%. The same can not be said about European Union, where the rate grew from 7.5% to 7.9% in one year. 
Latin American countries show good tendency: more people have found job in 2015 compared to 2014: the rates are 6.8% and 5.8% respectively. The last but not the least region is South Asia where the unemployment rate remain stable and low: only 3.9% of all citizens do not have a job there. 
The situation in the world overall did not change: high unemployment in African countries is balanced by South Asia, with other regions somewhat in the middle. The average rate worldwide is only 5.9%, which is quite suitable in economic terms.

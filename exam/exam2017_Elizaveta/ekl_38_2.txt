There is an argument that those who consume various commercial and art products as films and songs without paying for them must be punished, because their actions are evaluated as a theft. I completely disagree with this opinion for two reasons. 
Firstly, I am convinced that this is not the consumers fault. The ones who should be blamed for such problems are the so called "pirates", who still certain commercial products from their owners without paying any attention at the low that prohibits such actions. If usual people who download these stollen files had no opportunity to consume them, they wouldn't do this. Thus, in my opinion, the ones, who should be punished for the illegal actions are not the consumers who don't pay for the products, but the pirates that copy them. 
Secondly, it can be argued that all the music and most of the movies are frequently quite expensive, so that there are quite a lot of people who can not allow themselves buying such things. That leads some of them to break the law and download illegal copies of different art and commercial pieces. However, often most of the movies and singers became popular and famous thanks to them, because the main audience contains usual people that rarely earn to much money to allow themseleves a regular payed consumption of movies, etc. 
In conclusion, I agree that people who download illegaly copied files from the Internet shouldn't be punished for that because certain problems connected with their actions would not be soluted by this.

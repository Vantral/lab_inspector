The given bar chart presents dinamics in the level of unemployment between 2014 and 2015, refering to the data from Northen Africa, Middle East, European Union, Latin America, Southen Asia and also providing worldwide information. 
Overall, we have to claim that the rates of worldwide unemployment remained stable during this period of time. The arrange of regions with high or low level of unemployment did not experienc any change as well. Northen Africa, which had highest unemployment rates, saved both its position in this rating and the exact percentage of unemployed. The same can be said about Southern Asia, which keeps the highest rates of employment. However, we can observe a significant progress in the job proving in Middle East, decreasing rates from 11% to 9,6% in one year (it can be explained, though, by migration processes). On the other hand, the migration growth in the East resuted in slight increase of rates in the EU. I predict that it would be possible to observe the same correlation between Latin America, which shows a little dip in the amount of 1%, and USA. Unfortunately, the data for Northen America is not presented here. 
To conclude, despite some hesitations, the overall level of unemployment stayed stable during this period.

Every year musicians and producers of films suffer from making illegal pirate copies. Pirates copy and publish films and music in the Internet and millions of people download it in order to save money and not to buy the originals in the shops. There is an opinion that it is theft and those who do it must be punished. 
I agree that production of illegal pirate copies is a crime and there should be the punishment for doing it. Music and film industries spend a huge amount of money on making films, series, music and other things. Hence, they lose some part of their money because of pirate copies. People who make it and share it on the Internet break the law about personal property because films and music officially belong to its producers. As illegal copying is prohibited, "pirates" or people who do it should pay a fee or even be sent to prison. 
However, I can not absolutely agree that ordinary internet users who simply download pirate files should be punished too. As people pay for the Internet, they have a right to download everything they want and use all resources that are free for them there. Most of people who download pirate copies often do not know is it legal or not because there is no any warning about it in the Internet. Therefore, people should be awered about illegal copies in order to stop downloading it. 
In conclusion, pirate copying is very widespread in the Internet and people who copy films and music should take a punishment as it is illegal. They are responsible for these copies and money lost by musicians and films producers, but not ordinary people.

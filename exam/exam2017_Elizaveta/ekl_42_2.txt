It is true that musicians and film creaters lose enormous amounts of profit annually from illegal pirate copies. Therefore, I agree that people who download music and films break the law and should be punished. 
There are many reasons why one can consider the copying and sharing these files on the Internet is not a theft. They claim that people who can not afford to go to the cinema or musical festival and concert won't bring any more money to musicians and film producers, because they won't watch films and listen to music at all. For those who have money for these experiences, they have a right to choose what film makers and musicians worth to support to by watching their works at the cinemas and attending concerts. If creaters want to safe their money, they should protect their products by making the copying strictly forbidden at the cinemas and concerts. To conclude, people shouldn't be punished for downloading and sharing such content on the Internet. 
As for me, I agree with those who consider copying films and music as a theft. To begin with, these acts break author's property rights, which is illigal. Moreover, these acts have a side affects such as worse quality of products, because the industry of cinematography and music can not flourish due to the money demand. As far as creaters and producers are concerned, they tend to chose working in countries with strict rules and law, which protect their money. Therefore, I believe that tough punishment should be introduced for people who copy and the websites where sharing files takes place should be banned. 
To conclude, downloading and sharing films and music on the Internet, instead of buying the original discs is illigal and people who do it should be punished.

In current days, rate of the pirate sharing in Russia is noticably high. Moreover, since the Social Network "VKontakte" had emerged all of the audio and video files were shared there for free. In this essay I am going to provide some arguments whether copying and sharing music or films should be legal or not. 
There are several reasons for making this social phenomenon legal. First, most of the musicians and film producers commertionalized all of the industy around the world. As the profit became crucial films ond music has shifted their focus from cultural content to easy-sold one. For this reason, the product which the masses prefer is just the waste of money for the person with taste. In order to challenge the temptation of unsophisticated production people need to stop give money to producers and musicians. To name last, but not least, the historical context which is the formation of art tradition illustrates how hard was the work of creating masterpieces. For this purpose, money should not be the issue of the master, otherwise the culture around the world will continue to degrade. 
On the other hand, those artists who dedicated their life to producing music or film could simply lose their work. Most of them make living this way and do need money to eat. 
Despite the opposing opinion, I am strongly convinced that cultural consumption benefites from dark social sharing as it teaches people to choose what to watch or listen to.

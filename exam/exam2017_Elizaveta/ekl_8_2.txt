There is no doubt that the music and film industries develop and extand within each year. In some cases this leads to the appearance of illegal pirate copies, on the internet in particular. Some people believe that the ones, who participate in that kind of activity, instead of buying the original films or music songs, ought to be punished. I completely disagree with this statement and think that an open and free access to these files should be allowed. 
First, buying legal and original discs with person's favourite films and music songs may strike on his budget. Even if one song has a small price to be paid, tens, hundreds and even thousands of them may have a significant impact on the amount of money a person manipulates to invest in legal downloading. Moreover, when it is spoken about the film industry, the price usually rockets in two or three times. 
Second, the use of illegal pirate copies shortens the amount of time, spent on findings the necessary information, which often tends to be rare among the legal variety of possible offers. Moreover, some of the searched files, person is looking for, are under a strict safety, which means it is quite hard or even impossible to find them within the legal resources. 
To sum up, it has to be said that copying and sharing music, film files and other documentions should be permitted in order to allow every individual to have a fully access to all kind of information, he is willing to read, see, hear and to share it with the other ones.

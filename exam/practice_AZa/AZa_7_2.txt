There is an opinion that countries should produce only that is needed by it’s population and no more. The nearest aim is to decrease the import.
For example, the USSR was closed for the import of a lot of productive progressive useful products, not only food, but everything, and was that good enough for taking this historical example to the our time? Healthy international relationships are built on the trade platform too because the money is the main argument nowadays (maybe for our great disappointment). The economics can’t be progressive without the import-export relations. And, we should remember the example from the our time when the great quantity of imported food was roughly ruined by technics for the advance of the political interests but not for thousands hungry peoples. I sure that the healthy economic relations between the countries is one of the basical needs for peace in all the world. Beside this, do you remember about the unical climat in every country? This point makes impossible the existance of such phenomena of uncontactable national politics without the violating of human rights. 
I definitely agree with the statement that the needs of the population of the country are the first important thing for the government. But noone should forget about the international unions because if our governers can rightly positioned themselves on the world scene, this will protect future war conflicts. As I said, there are a lot of combined points of healthy international relations and every of them is unchangable and important.
I disagree with the statement about the decreasing of import because it can produce negative dinamics in our national economics. And, therefore, this is totally wrong position from the moral side.
In conclusion I should notice that I am generally accept and respect our political methods used by our governers and maybe the decreasing of import is the first step to something great and tremendous but that was not knew by myself.

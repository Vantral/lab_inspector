Nowadays there is a tendency to criticise the policy of the governments, which ingores the necessity to develope the food production of their own countries and allows importing a large amount of food from international countries. There are advanteges and disadvantages on this matter, both of which should be scrutinised.
On the one hand, the import has a negative inluence on the economic system of a certain country. The fact is that it has to import even those products, which it is capable of produciny itself. It happens, when the governments do not develope policy of food production in the country. Consequently, the coutry is in risk to become not only economically poor, but also politically dependent from other countries. Besides, when the country imports more than produces, it is difficult sometimes to control the quality of food. The foreign partners are not always interested in a good quality and healthy issues of hood, so they can cheat on it to make their bussiness more profitable.
On the other hand, it is not always possible for a country to produce all the range of products it needs due to the different issues such as climate, techical developement, etc. Thus, the country has to import food inevitably in oder to provide the nation with proper products.
Taking everything into account, it should be said, that importing is generally positive phenomenon of economic policy. However, in my view, the country should make an effort to improve its own production in order to avoid the pressure from foreign countries in terms of economics and politics.

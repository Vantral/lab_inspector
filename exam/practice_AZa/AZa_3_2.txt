Due to different reasons (political, economical) some people are assured that their government should produce the food which would be suitable exactly for the population of this government and do not use import products. To my mind, it is reasonable.
Firstly, such situation is the good way for developing ant country, for its economics. The production of the food undoubtably is unseparable from building factories due to this aim. It can overcome the problem of unemployment because due to the appearing plants the extra workplaces arise. It leads also to the development of domestic market. As we know, developed domestic market is one of the (indexes) values of success. Consequantly, such way of production id benefit for country’s economics. 
Moreover, some necessary materials and other products are needed for the production of food. And if these products is domestic, not import, it is better for health of population. As we know, the most part of modern people suffers from eating exactly import food goods. And the production of food from domestic products is more hopeful way. It is less difficult for government to punish some factories or companies if the cases of problems with population’s health take place. In addition, it is wonderful stimul for development of agriculture sphere. Nowadays the most of modern countries pay attention to the improving of industry, technology and few of them provide agriculture with financial support.
To sum up, the production of food directly for only government’s population and not using import products is an important part of country’s activity for its economical developmend and for a better life of people.

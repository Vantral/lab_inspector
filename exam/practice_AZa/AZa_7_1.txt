There are two graphs which are showing us the average temperatures in two totally different cities. First of all, we should notice differs win the general dynamics in two lines. On the first one we can see an increase on more than 60 °C during the first half of the year and the same decrease on the second part of the year. Another graph shows definitely another picture. The line of temperature is a bit vulnerable but the differs are situated in the 5 °C distance.
But there are the same points in two graphs. The differ between the maximum-line and the minimum-line is very close in Yakutsk-graph and in Rio de Janeiro graph.
To compare moreover the lines we should notice that if we contact the begin and the end of the Yakutsk-line, we will see the circle. But Rio de Janeiro shows another situation because the line is straight and just change a bit in the middle of the year.

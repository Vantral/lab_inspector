In the modern society there is a contraversial question about import from other countries. Some people think that is a usual tendency to import products. But the other part of society believes that countries should limit the level of import goods and try to develop their own industry. So where does the truth lie?
From my perspective, the governments of different countries should change their policy. Despite the imported can improve international relations and establish a link between countries, they also can be harmful for domestic economy.
It seems to me that countries should try to limit the import. First of all, this tendency will improve the domestic industry. Without imported products factories and plants will develop and create new ways of technologies to provide all the obligatory goods. Moreover, the level of economy can rise up significantly because of the taxes from plants.
Afterwards, the development of domestic economy can solve the problem of unemployed people. Without import the industrial sphere will grow and there will be more working places. Furthermore, investment to growing plants can improve the way of living. With rising number of working places people will be employed and have a salary for their activity. So, the level of social life of the country can show an upward trend.
In conclusion, this question is difficult to find a compromise. But in case of reducing import governments can not only solve the problem of unemployment, but also develop domestic industry by finding new sources and creating new ways of technologies to provide all the necessary products.

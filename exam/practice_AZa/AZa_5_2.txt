Nowadays, we are living in the “open” world and there is a great tendency to globalization. This means that almost each country communicate with another in different life areas, especially, in the sphere of commerce and trading. However, some people claim that economical protectionism is vital due to various reasons. I consider that both situations have advantages and disadvantages, so, I partly agree with the fact that some counties should care more about the innate economy and production.
I believe, that there are positive sides of this topic. For instance, the production of goods of the population of the concrete country only can push and somehow develop the economic situation there^ approximately all goods are available for people and the cost on them is low enough, because of domestic production. This situation was in the USSR and it really worked and gave benefits to economy.
On the other hand, such protectionism is profitable only in the frames of economic crisis or in another political situations (when the country is forming). Moreover, such politics in economy can be treated by other governments as a desire to be isolated from the world politics, as it can be clearly seen with the North Korean region now. Furthermore, import technology can enrich the diversity of products in shops, so, people are able to buy whatever they want. This happens, because some regions, for example, do not have good weather conditions which are suitable for pineapples. This way, pineapples may be imported from foreign country. Also, a normal level of import can create more job opportunities for the whole population.
All in all, this issue is complicated and controversial enough, and it needs further investigations. I am more likely to agree with the second opinion then disagree, because import in important for every country, so, nowadays it is normal that import plays a great role not only in domestic areas, but in international market too.

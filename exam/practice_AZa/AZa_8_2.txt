Some people have an opinion that it is not necessary for countries to produce more food then their own population eats. Apart from this, they believe that import items should take as little place as it is possible. I can not agree with this point of view, because I think it harms economic situation in countries alot.
Firstly, some countries do not have an opportunity to produce just a minimum value of food for their own population. Thats why they have to import a lot of products from another countries. In this situation, they have money to import food, because they export another kinds of items, for example, robots. 
This example illustrates the economical situation in Japan.
Secondly, some countries do not have high-developed technologies to export then and they earn money by selling food. If all countries will produce the value of products that they can eat by themselfs only, countries with developed agriculture will become poor.
In this case I do not think this is a good idea. Some part of this statement may be used sometimes, but not by every country in a whole world. I think that people, who support this theory talk about some African countries, which use this way of developing to stay alive. Probably, this is the only way for them to stay as a separate country.
To draw a condusion it is needed to point out that this way will not be siutable for a small countries also, for example, New Zehland. This country produces only fish, but it is difficult to eat only fish dishes. New Zehland export a lot of fish, but import not a little value of other kinds of food. To sum up, I do not think this theory is siutable for a whole world.

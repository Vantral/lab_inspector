Two pie charts illustrate the data about the goods transportation by rail and by road between European countries in 2008. The information is given in percentage. 
The first main trend is that last a quarter of whole transported goods by both means of carriage is manufactured goods. Another noticable trend, which combine both diagrams, is that chemicals transported by rail and by road are more than 10%. 
The deep look to the pie charts illustrates that metals are the primary transported goods by rail (more than 1/3 of whole transportation process), but the situation with road carriages another: the main part of transported goods is represented by food products. It consists 30%. It should be noted, the machinery, chemicals and non-metallic minerals together are for both transportation ways in amount of 30% of whole transported goods. 
Overall, the percentage of different types of goods transported by road and by rail is different in many cases.

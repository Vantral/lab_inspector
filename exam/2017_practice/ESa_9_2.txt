There is a common opinion that some of the mankind's last inventions trend to have a negative impact on our health. There is no doubt that there are some problems. I will consider them. 
Firstly, there is a serious problem of polluting our environment. Nowadays people try to develop the manufacturing sphere and completely forget about the wastes their factories produce. As a result, people living in industrial zones suffer from the diseases connected with breathing. Moreover, active using of electronic gadgets and different computer devices has a bad influence on our sight. According to the statistics, more than a half of the Earth's population has some problems in this sphere. The most common reason for this is overusage of phones, computers and so on. 
As for the possible solutions of these issues, there are a few of them. To my mind, the optimal solution of the first problem would be removing industrial zones away from the city. City administration could organise free transport from city to the industrial zone. Moreover, we can solve the second problem if we take measures to decrease the usage of electronic devices. In addition it will result not just in our physical health but in psuchological health as well. 
To sum up, modern technologies are aimed not harm or help but to make our life easier and to give us an opportunity to live in a more comfortable way. Although sometimes they can hurt us in some ways, we should not refuse from their usage. We should develop them.

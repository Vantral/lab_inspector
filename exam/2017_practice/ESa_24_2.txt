Novelties, such as computers and smartphones, have emerged recently, but already have a great influence on people's lives. One of the negative consequences of their influence are numerous health problems becoming more and more common among users. An opinion exists that a considerable number of diseases are caused and catalized by easy-to-access modern goods. 
The range of such misfortunes is rather wide, but they can be classified easily. Firstly, if consider this diseases chronologically, it is reasonable to name obesity as one of the oldest problems claimed to be caused by usage of television and computers. Not only do people tend to move less as they prefer sofa to sports, but also a habit of eating in front of the screen becomes the reason of excessive colories consumption and, as a result, gaining fat. 
Secondly, invention of even smaller than computer screens and, as a result, smaller fonts, leads to eyesight problems. However, it could not have such a fatal influence on people's ability too see if not for one more factor: people in modern society replace everything, even books, with digital screens. 
Finally, there is a theory that cell-phones or, to be more exact, the waves they are sending to the satellites, can catalyse the division of cancer cells. This claim seems to be even more negative as cancer is a "black death" of 21st century and still can be hardly cured. 
All in all, the range of health problems related to usage of modern technological devices, is wide. Nevertheless, the harmful influence of gadgets can be decreased by introducing new, more safe, environmentally-friendly and efficient technologies.

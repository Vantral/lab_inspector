It is considered that rapidly increasing amount of technologies integrated to our everyday life is not safe for the people's health. As the medicine develops, more information is collected. Sometimes this data illustrates considerably terrible processes and problems. 
For example, some researches contribute to increased number of patients who has eye diseases. Additionally, several laboratories are interested in affection of electromagnetic induction on human health. It is a commonly used technology used in microwave owens which mot citizens have at home. Everyone knows how well these devices can heat liquids, including water of which a human body mostly consists. However, there is no entirely accurate data about such influence. Another problem which scientists study a lot is desocialization. As Internet was developed speed and amount of transported information increased dramatically.

To be more exact, Japanese society is facing this problem nowadays as several amount of japanese choose being "trapped" in their apartments getting supplies through some services and refusing to contact the outer world. 
The mentioned problems definitely have to be solved in near future to reduce harmful effect of Progress on ones who are not able to deal with new technologies properly. The most promising way of helping the humanity to solve arosen problems is keeping on developing new technologies and concepts in all areas. In several years eye surgery may be able to cure and correct strong diseases whereas developed technologies will reduce harmful action of commonly used devices. A way of protecting from electromagnetic radiation is likely to be found and better socializing programms will be performed.

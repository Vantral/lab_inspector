This problem is very important nowadays. Using of modern technologies often connected with air pollution, water pollution. Many factories are involving in the creation of new technologies, the aim of which is to improve the world and people's lives. But there are some consequenses of this activity. The first one is air pollution, which affected people by different bad things, such as headache, bad feeling, and many others. The second one is water pollution. People can't enjoy the nature fully because of the mess lakes, rivers. A lot of bad-influenced factories are situated in towns with a great amount of people. This fact provides different problems and challenges which people should solve. Computerified society is some kind of a problem too. Every day a lot of people use gadgets, computers. It also has bad influence on people's health and totally on their eyes. The goverement should pay more attention to this problems. The goverement should reduce the level of any types of pollution. They should replace all-bad influence factories from cities to the special zones which are situated far from people. The next step is to control the activity of factories by the special comitet. What about gadgets, goverment should create the special schedule that can forbidden people to use gadjets and other electronic devices more than installing plan of time.

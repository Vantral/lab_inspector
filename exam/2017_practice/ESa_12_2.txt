Nowadays innovations became to a big part of our life. It is argued that modern technology could be used less then we can see today, because of their causing effects on our health. This ESSAY agreed with that suggestion completely, because of increasing numbers of people who have health problems. 
Firstly, my own knowledge is expecting that a lot of people have problems with their eyeside. The biggest part of them took that problem because spend a lot of time at the computer. A reason that computer has is the main factor of health problems. Nevertheless, how can we become stronger and reduse bad influence of computer? All people of the world must ask themself a question about time that they spend with electronic devices. If IT-technology takes a lot of time of their life they must choose production with less bad influence. 
Secondly, many people have problems like psycological diseases. Nowadays, temp of life has always increasing. Organisms of teenagers and young adults do not ready for that. As a result of that people come to psycologists and they help them to overcome stressfull zone and became in a well mind. 
To sum up, I hope that I can managed to convince you that widespread use of modern technology is causing an increasing number of health problems. Our sociality should be careful with inovations. It is a bad fact that modern technology causing all sides of our life. So I hope that in the future people would find the answer to the question awording to redusing bad influence of modern technology.

The following diagram show us the two main types of transport used for the delivery of goods. Each pie chart represents the structure of deliveries. 
Talking about the rail, it is especially popular for transportation of metals (35%) and manufactured goods (25%). As for other types of cargos, their share is nearly equal (â‰ˆ11%). 
As for road transportation, almost one third of all the cargos is food products (30%). The second biggest one is manufactured goods (28%). Metals, chemicals and non-metallic minerals have an approximately equal share of deliveries (11%-16%). But the share of the machinery transportation is quite little (only 2%). 
If we compare this pie charts we can see that manufactured goods are transported by both means of transport. But metals are more often delivered by railway while road transportations better suit for food products. All the other types of cargos have a nearly equal shares in both types of deliveries (from 10% to 16%).

Nowadays the problem of pirate content is very widespread. Some people believe that it is important only to by such content especially if this content is associated with musicians and film producers. The others prefer to use pirate copies. So, there are various opinion on the point. I completely agree with idea that everybody should pay for other men's labor, so the government should punish people who make pirate copies and who spread it. It can be proved by some arguments. 
To begin with, all money which musicians and producers are not get from pirate copies may be leant to developing their industry and making new unique art smashing content. The leak of resourses sometimes slows down process of making it. 
Then, using illegal pirate copies is iquel with stealing goods. Modern governments usually punish robbers, that is why, this rule should be spread to such content. 
Finally, the ban of using illegal copies will dicrease a shadow sector of an economy of a country. It will lead to growing of cashflow to dealers too. 
So many men, so many minds. We cannot say that this or that opinion is wrong. But in this particular case a punishment for spreaders and users of illegal content will bring to life a lot of positive results. which one associated with clearing an economy, growing benefits for dealers and increasing of motivation level among musicians and film producers. The government may establish low price for such content to make it available for big masses of people.

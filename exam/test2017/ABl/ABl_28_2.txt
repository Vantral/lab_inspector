Nowadays one of the most great problems for those, who produce entertainment items like music and films is the prospecity of pirate copies of their products. So, there are 2 views on the existence of such phenomena. 
From the one hand, everyone should respect such talented people as musicians and producers who provide us with really useful things for our relaxing or scientific satisfying. Thus, they must have a right to be paid for their work and users of the Internet who download pirate files should be punished for illegal enjoyment. Furthermore, the copying and sharing music or films in of non-original form lead to deteriorating of the products' quality. The reason of it can be films recorded on videocameras from cinemaparks or music, recorded on the concerts. In such way it seems that people of art producing really waste their money to create a good proffesional picture or sound. 
On the other hand, in the era of developing technologies it is really convenient to use social networks or specialized applies as a platform to store music compositions or films. Thus, many people are ready to commit a law and have a free wealth. However, this problem is decided by Apple corporation which has a huge music resource free for three months. Moreover, there is a problem of people's equality. It is considered that everyone should have a right to use a wealth which is made and prepared to public. So, it should be available not only for those people who have a financial opportunity to pay for listening for a music or watching films. 
To sum up, it is really important for musicians and film producers to share their "masterpieces" with all people in equal form.

The chart below gives us information about the unemployment rate in a selected years in N. Africa, Middle East, EU Latin America, S. Asia and Word wide. 
First, we can see differences between two years - from 2014 to 2015 the unemployment rate decreased, but slightly and not everywhere. If in N. Africa and S. Asia there is no changes in the unemployment rate, in Middle East and Latin America results are better. Second, it is need to say that the world wide unemployment rate, as we see didn't grow or declay. There are several reasons of it - when in some areas the situation is stable, in another ones the unemployment rate rises and declays (in EU, for example). 
To summarise, the chart shows changes in the unemployment rate in some world regions. Changes from no one year (2014) to another (2015) are not dramatically and in some region we even see the same results (12,5% in N. Africa, 3,9 in S. Asia and 5,9 Worlwide).

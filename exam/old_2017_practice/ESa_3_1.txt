The charts represent the data on the percentage of goods transported in the Eastern Europe in 2008. The first chart provides data on the railway transportation of goods, while the second chart represents data on the transportation of goods by road. It can be noticed that the are substantial differences in the percentage of cargo such as metals, machinery and food products transported by rail and by road.

The percentage of metals transported by railroads is 35% of all the cargo transported by rail in 2008 in the region, while the amount of metals transported by roads is substantially lower â€” it is only 12% of the goods transported by roads. A similar tendancy can be observed for machinery. 12% of all goods transported by railroads consisted of machinery, yet this number was far lower within the area of goods transported by roads and constituted only 2% of the cargo. On the other hand, the percentage of food products transported by rail was only 11% of all railroad cargo, while for the road transported goods this type of cargo was estimated to constitute 30% of road transportation.

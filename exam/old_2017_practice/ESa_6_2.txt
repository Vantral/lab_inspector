The modernisation process has both health damages problems and social-health damages problem, however the negative influences of modern technology can be reduced by goverment and self-care.

The wide spread of modern technology is causing firs of all problems with helth, for example long-time tiring, stress, decline of immune. These problems can be the basis of new for society social problems such as not changing angy mood and agressive, no opportunity to state the negotiations, and have good attitudes to everyone and eachone. This argession would break the social structure, all society from inside and even become a reason of new conflict between people, social groaps or even the contries. Thus, ignore of this serious issue can leads the negative results, such as World War. However, rational policy to solve and restrict the negative impact of modern technology would allow to avoid this catastrofy.

The goverment have to strict the using of mobile phone and Internet among young generation, because children will determine future life of our society and because of the using of mobile phone creates a crazy depending on it and has other negative influences on human health, particulary on opportunity to see 100% of life by eyes, without glasses. Moreother the goverment should provide the supporting of sport, because the modern technology allows to live without any phisical activity. This programm must have popularity among all generations. Moreover, people should care about their health by them-self and restrict them-self in using of mobile phone and other perhaps harm-fasilities of modern world, also they should remember about phisical activity and do exercises.

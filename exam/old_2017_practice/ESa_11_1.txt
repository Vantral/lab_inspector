These two diagrams show us different types of goods which are usually transported by rail and by road.

Judging by first diagramme, we can see that rail type of transport is use most of all for transportation of metals (about 35%) while the road transportation carry metals just in 11% of all shipments. Besides, it’s obvious, that both means of transport are equal use for carrying manufactured goods (25% by rail, 28% by road). Moreover, second diagramme shows us that the third part (30%) of road transportation is used for carrying food products, while rail transport carry food products rarely (just 10%). Besides, we can see, that both means of transport carry a small amount of chemicals (12% — part of rail transportation, 16 — part of road carrying). Therefore, the smallest type of good which can be transported by rail is non-metallic minerals (6%) while the analog group in road transportation is linked with machinery, which take just 2% of all road transportation.

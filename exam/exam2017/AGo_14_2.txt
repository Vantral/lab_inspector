Nowadays there are many people who claim that states should provide entire food-supply for themselves and avoid importing goods to other countries. However, I believe that there are both pros and cons for countries of producing food for their own population only. In this essay I will look at drawbacks of growing food for only one country's people and prove that they outweigh benefits. 
The proponents of the view that the state should provide full food supply for it's citizens forget about the important fact that many countries don't have opportunities to provide all their people with food due to lack of territory or resources. However, they can produce essential goods like durables, clothes or vehicles and exchange them on crops and meat. If countries produce goods only for themselves, some people will starve to death and others will lose an opportunity to use cutting-edge technologies which can improve farming and breeding. 
Those who consider the country consuming only what it produces is better than exporting goods turn a blind eye on the fact that some states are specialized on producing specific kinds of food, while other ones are better in producing beverages or growing crops. By helping each other and exchanging different food types, countries will be able to make their communities thrive. For example, France is the best in producing vine, while Switzerland is well-known for it's cheese. As they trade with each other they can offer food of the best taste and quality on their market. 
All in all, there are many disputable aspects in the forms of isolating one country from others. However, the states can develop and flourish only if they co-operate and support each other.

Nowadays the problem of great import amounts has become very urgent. There is a tendency to suppose that a country should be able to provide as many food supplies as they need and reduce the import to the minimum. However, each country needs import in large amounts for their people to survive, because of various ecological reasons that can occure to every country. 
Firstly, a country can suffer from natural desasters. Floods, earthquakes, hurricanes can destroy entire cities, as well as fields with crops. These can't be foreseeen or prevented, so because of that the nation might suffer from famine as the part of food has been destroyed. Due to the import, the vital part of food could be bought from the other countries. 
Secondly, food supplies can suffer from insects which can also destroy the crops. Using various chemicals can make the situation even worse and damage the crops as well. Italian crops suffering from giant apple snails, Chineese rice suffering from insects caused lots of problems to the government of their countries and without import the concequences of these situations could be even more devastating. 
One might say that the government can produce special places to keep extra food for such times, which can be used in case of famine. However, even this amount of food might not be enough or it can simply run out of time, because it is impossible to store food forever. 
All in all, I agree with the idea that import is essential for any country to provide their people everything they need and help them in case they have suffered from numerous ecological problems.

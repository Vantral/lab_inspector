Nowadays, we have the popular opinion concerns the food sector of production and economy: government should concentrate on food production only to their citizens, without importing goods to other countries. Talking about my personal opinion, I strongly believe that import is the one of the most important and profitable ways to held countries economy; so I disagree with that statement. First of all, governments should think about the international cooperation and development of all spheres. Because of globalization, healthy economic relationships between countries are not possible without the importing goods. Import lets countries exchanging technologies, goods and, also earning great amounts of money for their budget. Another argument concerns "comfort zones" of citizens. As we all know, because of sanctions, some europian countries are not allowed to import food to Russia. This sanctions impacts not only on europian food production countries, but also on russian citizens: because of climate and undeveloped technologies russian farmers and companies are not able to produce some kinds of food and goods. The last, but not the least, argument is that importing and exchanging food can help poor countries. It is well known, that some african and eastern countries cannot produce too much food for their people. That's why hunger - is one of the most important and huge problem their even in 21st century. Some well-developed countries support different fonds and organisations, that help people in need. Of course it will be impossible, if government decided to produce the food only for their own population. To sum up, I should say, that nowadays any countries economy cannot stay developing and "alive" without importing. Also there are many hungry and poor people that should be supported.

In the recent times the problem of athlets using prohibbited drugs to get advantage in sports has become extremely popular among people. The opinion of society in regards to the fate of the caught sportsmen and sportswomen differs. Some people believe that such athlets should be punished for the rest of the life while other think that a ban for a limited period would be enough. Let's begin with the first point of view. These people definitely have a point because all athlets are aware of consequences and they know that cheating in sports is probably the worst thing as it destroys the nature of competition. As well as this there's also a chance that drugs can leave traces in blood and even change it, so the sportsmen or sportswomen will be "marked" for the rest of the life. Second point of view is less strict. These people base their opinion on the fact that it's normal for a human being to make mistakes and that athlets' lives should not be ruined because of a mistake. They also point out that caught sportsmen and sportswomen will carry on with a bad opinion of society about them which will put extra emotional weight. As for me, I drift towards second opinion. I totally agree with this point of view and I think that there are more reasons to support this position. For example, if a really great athlet, who earned all of his or her achievments legitemately and then tried to take drugs but immediately got caught, he or she doesn't deserve "a death penalty". And banning an athlet permanently is equal to a death penalty for them. So, if a sportsmen or a sportswomen cheats they should be able to return later or at least become a trainer. To summ up, the controversy regarding punishment for athlets, that got caught using illegal drugs, will live on forever as it comes down to each individual personality, character and strictness.

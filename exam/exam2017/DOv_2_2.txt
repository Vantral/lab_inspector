More and more young people are stunding on the slippery slope of crime. They don't want to earn money by themselves, thinking that its easier to rob a person or even kill him or her for money. Parents and teachers should prevent it by promoting and establishing right values among children and teenagers. Adults should also encourage young generation to build a successful career. 
It is very hard for young people to find their place in the modern world. And the thought that they can get money without work seems very appealing to them. So, instead of studying at the schools and universities, they start, for example, selling drugs. 
This lack of motivation to live a decent life boils down to a not proper raising them as a children. And this is a mistake of their parents and children. Parents and teachers should explain why it is morally wrong to lead a life of crime. They should spend more time on bringing them up and teaching them the right values. 
Adults should also help the young generation to build a career. There would be no incentives to commit crimes, if earning money by a decent work was as easy as earning money by doing illegal things. Of course, that cannot be reached, but we should strive to that. Parents and teachers should encourage young people in their endeavors and not to discourage them from reaching their dreams. 
It is very important to determine the causes of the increased crime rate among young people, so we can find a better solution to the problem.

That is really hard question for people to organize economical in their countries. Some of them learn hard in the universities and work hard in the government to answer this question. Watching these people provide us information about lots of process and producing food for population and import with export is one of them. 
I can agree with statement that countries need to produce the food that their own population eats and should aim to import as little as possible. But there is one more obvious thing here. I think it is clear for us that producing the food more that their population eats is better way for countries. That is my own opinion. 
It is easy to understand that it is excellent way to give food to all your population. There are some reasons. For example, workplaces in food industry. If you want to produce more food you need more resources and workers. That solve another problem, which called unemployed. Second reason is economical and food stability, when other countries have less influence to out country and it gives us something like shield. 
Second and the last point of my view is 'import and export'. My version of organization food politics is decreasing import as possible and increasing export. What does it mean? Decreasing import gives us safe and stable future, where country can avoid global economical problem. On the other side, export gives country money (not only that because gold is the way too) and make the nation rich. By the way we should avoid corruption.

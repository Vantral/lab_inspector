One of the highly controversial issue today relates to wheather to banned athletes from competing due to illegal drugs for limited (2 years) period or unlimited. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from the both points of view and then give my own opinion on the matter. On the one side of the argument there are people who argued that the benefits of prohibition for all time consederably outweight disadvantades. First of all, if one of the athletes is banned, others will not consume illugal drugs, because of this risk. It is also possible to say that there will no way to return in profession sport and consumption of illegal drugs will mean the end of career. On the other hand, it is possible to make the opposing case. People often argued that it is unfair to banned due to drugs. There are many examples when people understood their bad behavior and then reformed. Everybody should have a second chance for reforming their mistakes. The fact is that sport is challenging, difficult and for strong people. This is main cause that dectaited for athletes to use the light ways. For two years athletes have thought about that illugal drugs are unfair for others and the competions should be provided clear, fair game. In conclusion, I believe that the both arguments have their merits. On balance, hovewer, I tend to the first side from this topic, because you must pay for your mistakes. Besides, it is a big fail, because drug is the global epidemic in our society and it must be pay our attention.

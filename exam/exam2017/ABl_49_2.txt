Nowadays, when every one has the Internet connection, it's easy to download any music or films that you want and don't pay anything. Such people are pirats and I'm fully agree with the point of view that the pirats should be punished. 
First of all, the musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies. That's why the quality of music and films is decreasing. Because the artists don't get one full amount of money, they couldn't use it to make better music or films, they don't have any evidences that their next work wouldn't be downloaded from the Internet for free. 
Secondly, it's obviously, that every work should be paid off. For example, we pay for the food in the supermarket or for the any other material thing. But it's hard to pay for something that you can't feel in your hand. But, as for me, there is the same logic and people don't download the film, for example, they steal it, like they can steal a fruit in the supermarket. 
Thirdly, when we buy an illegal copy of the product, we don't get the full emotions, because of such copies have the bad quality, not so beautiful print, for example, and many other things. Moreover, I think, that buying one pirate copy of the music or film we don't make a special connection between the artist and the consumer. 
And last, but not least, is that the illegal pirate copies aren't good for the economy of the countries. Buying the legal copy, you pay a special fee, which can be used, for example, for the social systems of the country. Stealing the music you make bad things for the artists, but for the other citizens of the country too. 
All in all, the pirats should be punished, because they are stealing the product like some thing in the shop. They are just tipical thief who who are destroing the economy of the country and don't get the full spectrum of emotions from the amazing works of musicians and film producers.

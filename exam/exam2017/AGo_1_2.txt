The Problem of need in foreign food supplies and lack of native production is facing among vast range of countries nowadays. Some people supports the idea of narrowing down the ammount of products that are imported and manifucturing local food for citizens of this curtain country. Meanwhile, there are some major drawbacks of this belief. 
On one hand, the eliminating of food that were imported may end up in the lack of variety to choose from for customers in shops and malls. But it does not mean that buyer would not be able to find a replica for some kinds of food. For example, if country wants to narrow down the quantity of sugar, solt and apples that are brought to this country in order to help local production, a customer probably will not even notice this fact. 
On the other hand, there are still some products, that cannot be produced in all countries such as fresh ocean fish, Asian rice, and some sorts of Japanaese meat, but can be easily imported and become irreplaceble in everyday routine. In this cases government could do two things: to begin a new production area or do import. Knowing the fact that, for country it is easier and cheaper to import than manifucturing it. 
However, eventhough most products can be produced at local farm and factories, there are some types of food that had to be imported because of vast range of reasons. The most common is that for country's consuptional rate of such products are low does not worth the money it takes to produce it. In addition, the local production may not benefit and will be broke in a few years. 
To sum up, the eliminating of import and producing evething inside one country in order to feed citizens is controversial issue that needs clever solutions from government.

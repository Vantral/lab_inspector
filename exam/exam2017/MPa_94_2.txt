The issue of food production in today's globalized world appears to be urgent and causes lots of discussions, as natural reasons for specializing in this sphere inevitably influence on trading strategees of different countries. So, there are people, who are against any import of food, while the other support trade if a country is rich by its food resources. I am personally inclined to the second view of the problem. There is an evidence that practically no state in contemporary world can provide its population with a bundle of food products we statistically got used to consume thanks only to national agriculture. It's known as common that this is one of the driving forces of international trade, and, for instance, the import of rice may allow the government to purchase fruits grown in southern countries. One more economic benefit of balanced import is an opportunity of agricultural development pushed significally by the trade. It might also positively influence on logistic corporations and trade management, that supply the section of food products' realizing. In conclusion, the profits of effective trade in agricultural sector, that particularly includes the import of products, apparently overweight any threats of it. The main point here is that today food trading seems to be necessary for each country in the world.

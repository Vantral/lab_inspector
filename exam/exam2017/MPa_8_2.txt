One of the most controversial issues today is that sportsmans started to use illegal drugs to increas their results. Some people argue that they should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period, while others think that athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. In this essay, I will examine this question from both points of view and give my own perspective on the situation. On the one hand there are many benefits to ban athletes for the rest of their lives. One of them is that it will be a good example for other people who were not caughted or who wanted to use drugs. Also it will be more fair because the majority of athletes trained their body by themselves without using this kind of stuff. On the other hand, it will be too unfair to not give them a chance to return to a professional sport, because it was probably the only way to make money and they have a family which is depended only on this money. In addition, it can be said that it can even break their lives only because they made a mistake, for instance, in young age. Overall, I think that there is no denying that athletes should be banned for using illegal drugs, but it is too unfair to ban them for the rest of their lives.

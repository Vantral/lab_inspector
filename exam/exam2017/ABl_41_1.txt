the graph below shows us some statistics on the unemployment in 2014 and 2015 in selected world regions. 
Firstly, the thing which is necessary to admit is that Northern Africa and Middle East take first positions in this sphere. From my point of view, it is so because of the high level of terrorism. War is dominating in these state and this is the cause of that businessmen leave these countries and people lose their jobs. 
Secondly, I would like to notice that Southern Asia has a very low level of unemployment. This is the cause of high level of post injustfisation which creates exrenent conditions for business thanks to which the level of unemployment was steadily going down in the previous years. 
In addition, I would like to observe some rapid changes in the EU, Latin America and Middle East: 1) European Union has a big migrant income which to that fact that migrants get jobs and it creates a gap for europeans which increases the level of unemployment. Peasants from Syria left Middle East for Europe which made a plummet for them. 3) Latin America is having a big increase in GDP., reaching new peast and creating working seats they decrease the unemployment. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that worldwide level should stay on the same level because the main contradictions are happening between the EU and Middle East which creates a balance.

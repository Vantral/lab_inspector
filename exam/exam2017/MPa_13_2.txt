There is much controversy surrounding the use of banned substances by proffessional athletes. One side argues that drug abuse is a serious enough offense to justify a lifetime ban from all professional sports events. Others believe that offenders should only be suspended temporarily. It is true that partaking in illegal drugs to increase one's performance should not be taken lightly. Therefore it is logical to assume that athletes caught red-handed should be banned from competing proffesionally for the rest of their lives. It stands to reason that such an individual has compomised their integrity and cannot be trusted to not make the same mistake again. Moreover, an offense of this kind would put into question all past and future achievents of an athlete, further reinforcing the idea that there are no second chances in professional sports since it places such value in the fairness of competion and character of the athletes. On the other hand, it is evident that it is in the human nature to make mistakes, therefore everyone deserves a chance for redemption despite their previous shortcommings. Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to closely monitor an athlete, who returns to competions after a temporary ban. For example, certain steps may be taken to ensure that a reformed drug user does not fall back to their old ways. Such measures include but are not limited to daily blood tests, random medical exams, and mandatory drug tests before major competitions such as the olymics or national finals. In conclusion, I side with those, who propose a limited time detention from competing professionally, since it is an inherently better disciplinary action to help struggling sportsmen to regain their integrity rather than completely ban them without giving a chance to compete fairly without performance boosting drugs ever again.

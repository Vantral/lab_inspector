There is a belief that countries agricultural sectors should concentrate on the type of food that is mostly consumed by the population. Considering this, the countrys imports should fall down to minimum. However, it might not be the most sufficient way. Globalization is a more suitable policy to an agricultural sector of any country. Through usage of global trade in differenciation of labor most of the Third world countries could start the provision its citizens with food and dealing with the problem of famine. Secondly globalisation might be the best way for the developed countries such as the USA, China and Brazil. These countries with large territories have a great opportunity to invest in their agricultural sector and expand imports. Agricultural sector is one of the biggest areas on the global market. By expanding imports these countries does not work only for themselves but also helping countries with which agricultural sector is in a recession. This recession can be caused by climate change as droughts, floods, earthquakes and by human interrogation in the environment. The third reason why globalisation can help countrys economy is the labor differenciation. It helps to provide poor countries with experienced labor force and to meet new workplaces to a country with a big deal of unemployment. To conclude, I may say that I do not support the opinion described in the statement. However the point of view described above seems to be a more apropriate way of developing the economies of the modern day society.

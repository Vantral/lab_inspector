The two given diagrams provide an information about the average highest and lowest temperatures in two cities, which are Yakutsk located in Russia and Rio de Janeiro situated in Brasil. It is clear from the graphs that the data is collected over a one year period from January to December. At first blush, a great disrepancy can be noticed between winter periods in the cities. For instance, the temperature on January can fluctuate from -35°C to -40°C virtually in Yakutsk, whereas in Rio de Janeiro the situation is just the opposite. Another point worth mentioning is in the resemblance of June and August maximum temperatures in Yakutsk and minimum one in Rio de Janeiro that are counting for 20°C. Apart from that, a further perceptible difference can be observed in the fact that the indicators of temperature in Yakutsk change from about -45°C to 25°C overall, yet in Rio de Janeiro the temperature does not even reach zero point. On balance, the climate situations on two investigated countries palpably differ from each other.

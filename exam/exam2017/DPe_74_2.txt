Nowadays pirating become a huge problem for musicians, film authors and writers. But is it obligatory to fight with pirates or we can find another way to solve the problem? 
We are living in the century of Internet, so for many people copying and sharing files is a daily routine. Must they be punished for those? I think it is not their fault. 
The problem is the web services that sell films, music and books are not always comfortable for users. For example, two years ago buying music for your Iphone was a long process and free downloading was more easy and quick for users. But now there is a service called Apple Music which helps you to downoad legal music for a small fee. Most of my friends have changed the way of listening to music since the Apple Music service came to Russia. 
The second point is what authors think about pirates. Not each musician, film director or writer concider that those who downloads files illegaly should go to jail. For example, the sons of Russian fantasts brothers Strugatskiye make the web-versions of the books free. The main argument is "who want to pay - will pay". Many musicians also do the same thing. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that we must take it easy. Content-authors will not stay poor. Their fans will always find the way to pay them for work. If they respect authors, of course.

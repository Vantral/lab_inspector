It is popularly considered that agricultural sectors in countries should grow necessary food for their population whereas the import is to be limeted. I partially agree with this statement, namely I am not accept the fact that a country produces food only for its own citizen and I partially agree with the idea that import must be cut. First of all, production of food is closely connected with the location of a country. Actually, southern countries have quite more preferences in specializing in this kind of production. Thus, growing some crops could be more effective in countries which geographical location is rather appropriate for these activities. Furthermore, some northern countries are not able to get satisfactory crops of some cultures due to severe climate conditions. For instance, to obtain good crops of rice, it is necessary to flood large fields with water. Another example is a well-known fact that corn cannot grow in the climate conditions close to Russian ones. Hence, some countries should refuse to consume some kinds of food which they are not able to grow themselves owing to the idea that countries produce food only for their citizens. Another argument supporting my point of view is that exporting food entails some advantages for the exporter. Obviously, export contributes to the national economy and promotes effective usage of the country's resourses. Taking all these into account, it is quite better to provide another countries with food they cannot produce themselves via exporting. In fact, cutting the quantity of imported goods has some pluses. Firstly, importing is not always beneficial for the importer. It is evident that there are a lot of tax barriers caused by import. Besides, if a country can produce a product on its own, it will inevitably import it. Summing it up, countries should produce food for which they have comparative advantage and sell it.

One of the most controversial issues nowdays relative to whether sportsmen who use dopping should be banned for some amount of years of should they be banned forever. On the one hand there are no doubts that politics affects international sport what causes falcifications in medical tests to ban athletes of hated country to put shadow of shame on it. As a result sportsmen would not be allowed to participate competitions and all people find that it is not fair. In this case banning for several years instead of unlimited ban prevents not-cheating sportsmen from aborting their careers. Another point is that some kinds of drugs are included in medicines which injured sportsmen have to take in order to restore their health and sport society knows examples when these medicines were detected as drugs. It shows that medical tests have their weak points, and it may be better to stay punishemts not so strickt until we find out how to detect cheaters more accurately. On the other hand it is also possible to say that there are few real dopping-addicted sportsmen who use these illigal benefits to overwhelm other competitors. It force fair sportsmen to use drugs what is unbelievable. And even after several bans they might use drugs again due to addiction, that is why they have to be prevented from participating in any competitions for the end of their life to save sport community heathy. I personally believe that each occasion of suspecting in dopping using is unique and it should be judged personally.

The graphs show the average maximum and minimum temperatures in Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. First picture gives us some information about temperature in Yakutsk. We could see two curves of maximum and minimum temperature. This graph looks like mountain, with increasing of maximum from January (-35), top in July (+25°C) and falling down to the end of the year (-34°C). Minimum curve looks like maximum curve with start from -41°C, to the top 12°C and the end -40°C in December. Second picture shows us temperature in Rio de Janeiro. And this graph curves are much more calm than at first picture. We can see a little decrease from 30°C to 25°C. Minimum curve goes the same, but from 23°C to 18°C in July. Comparison of these two graphs is incorrect because there are many difference between these cities. Yakutsk is located in Syberia and there are very cold winters and short summer. But Rio is located in subtropic zone and have the same temperature all the year. Moreover, Rio is located in South half of Earth and when winter comes there, in Russia summer begins.

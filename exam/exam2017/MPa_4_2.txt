On of the most controversial issues today in sport is using illegal drugs. It boost abbilities of sportsmen such as power, reaction and other. I am going to examine this question. On one side people think that athletes who use illegal drugs should be banned from sport for a limited period - from 1 to 5 years. I agree with that statement, if man use boost first time, because it justice. All professionall sportsmen in sport from childhood and they will can't change their life and not realise in other part of society. Athletes understand that they doing mistake and forgot this way to boost in sport and try win legal. On the other side other people want to ban athletes from competing professionally for the res of their lives. it very evil opinion because it is drammaticly. Many sportsmans want to suicide. It is unhumanity. I disagree with this point. Every man in world must have second chance to fix their mistakes.

Nowadays, import and export processes have become an integral part of every countries economy. Howeve, some people uphold that such kind of processes are able to decline total level of economy and government should try to avoid them. At the same time, others tend to belive that this point of view is ambigous. I partly agree with this statement. From an economic standpoint, reduction of import usually lead to significant development of all sectors of economy especially food industry. Producers without imported goods have much more amount of capacity to produce their own products and goods improve them and obtain profit for future technological developments. In addition, imported goods sometimes have an indeed awful quality, by dint of short period of keeping some kind of milk products or vegetebles. Thats is why expantion and improvement national food industry will help to avoid such kind of problem. However, supporters of imported goods point out that restriction of foreign products will lead to great problems in economy especially in develoving countries, which have weak economic sistems and do not have ability to support food sector by themselve. This scenario is able to become the beggining of tremendous cosial and medical issues such as hunger and dificit of the basic foodstaf. Moreover, without imported food citizens not only in developing countries but also in industrialised ones get a really insignificant choice of food products. It is imposible to improve variety of foodstuff immediately after ending of import process. For this reasons, countries without imported products have an experience of depression due to low difference in food. In conclusion, it should be noted that import of food is a mixed blessing, but despite all possible drawbacks countries are not able to avoid this essential economic process.

In fact pirate copies led to different producers lose their benefits every year. That is why a lot of people think that downloading of music or films without paying money for that production should be punished. There are some advantages and disadvantages of this point of view. 
First and foremost, people spend a lot of money, huge sums to do a new film or music composition and it is unfaire when they are not able to get their money. Internet survesis get access to cope and share of somebody's production. Perhaps, this types of sites should be block. And then authors' rights will not break. 
Moreover, arctors, producers, musicians, directors and other people who work in this industry should get their salary for their job. Sometimes people do understand that produsing of films is very expensive. Legal copies let to get a compensation. 
That is why people who find and download files just stil them. And it is a type of crime. People who do crime should be punished. Different punishment led to increase of buying the original product (files, discs). 
However there is another point of view. Persons who download pirate copies are not muders. They just try to share with people moves and beautiful music compusitions. Of course, some people feel like spending money for buying the legal copies is not productive and it can be too costy spend money to every film or disc of music. They do not care about people who make this production. In their oppinion, copying and sharing music or films on the Internet help them save money. 
To sum up, punishmend for pirate copies should be in the state to provide authors' rights, but in my oppinion they should not be very strict. Maybe shtrafs will be very suitable, can help producers get their benefits and will be useful for goverment and budget.

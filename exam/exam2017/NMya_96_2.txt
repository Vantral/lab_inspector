There is an idea that countries should produse food only to cover their own population needs and lower the import as much as possible. I am complitely disagree with this idea because wise import and export of food benefits the country. 
First of all, food export is a economically beneficial strategy. If a country can produce more than consume, it always can earn extra money for a budget by selling food to neighbours. Secondly, food import spreads natural resourses among all mankind. Obviously, that some countries cannot produse some kind of food due to the location orl weather factors, but they can get it in exchange for money or othe resourses from other countries. Moreover, rich nations can help poor ones by sending them food, if government understand that they have far more that they need. This logic also works in case of helping population suffering from natural disasters. At last, food import allow citizens to taste foreign cuisine, and full writing can make population more happy and healthy. 
To sum up, there are enough arguments to say, that food import and export is benefitial for country in many ways. Presumably, closing the food traffic and consentraiting only at covering population needs - is a dead end for almost every country development.

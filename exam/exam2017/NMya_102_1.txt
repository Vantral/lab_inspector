The presented pair of diagrams display information about international transportation of goods within the Eastern Europe, year 2008. Transportation is done with two ways: by rail and by road. 
First of all, it can be seen that metals are mainly transported by rail, making up 35% of the traffic, whereas roads are busy with food transportation, which is responsible for 30% of the traffic. In contrast, only 11% of road transportation consists of metal and food, accordingly. 
The second main difference is machinery, taking up 12% of rail traffic and 2% of road traffic. it is compromised by the fact that the share of non-metallic minerals is almost twice as large on rail than on road, making up 13% in the last case. 
It is also worth noticing that manufactured goods take up similar shares: 25% on rail and 28% on road. Finally, 16% of the road traffic is chemicals, while on rail it is only 11%.

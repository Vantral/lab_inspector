This two graphs represent us the information about temperatures in two cities from different parts of the world - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Yakutsk, Russia. Both graphs illustrates the average temperature during the whole year from January to December. Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro are situated in different climate regions. This aspect explains the diversity between the graphs lines. First of all, talking about Yakutsk, we should admit the great and huge amplitude between the maximum and minimum temperatures. The highest one - 25°, was noticed in July - it is the middle of the summer in Russia; and the lowest is -40° fixed in January and December. Talking about Rio de Janeiro, the situation differs. The amplitude is only about 13 degrees. Also we should admit, that the highest temperature was observed in January - the middle of the summer in Brazil. To conclude, I can say that climate zones made an great effect on amplitude and average temperature. Our examples is the aproovement of this statement.

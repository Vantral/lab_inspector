Every year government and film production companies are struglling with illegal distribution of copies of films, music, books and other forms of art. Some people disagree with this decision because of many reasons. 
First of all, there is a group of people, who stands for free access to any art. The main function of film or a song is to contain a special message, and the more people get this message the better for song or film. Actually, it is an old tradition of distribution songs or fairy tales from one person to another, from one speaker to another. Personally I agree with such method, because it has positive effect. When people share ideas, then they can create something new and different restrictions stop the process of creation. 
In addition, many experts claim that it is hard to stop and control the process of making copies and how many people download them. Moreover, it will be very expensive and, as a result, the price for a disk will dramatically rise. It will lead to decreasing of revenue for film producers and film companies. 
Also, if they try to control distribution of copies and rise the price, there is a probability that the author of the film or song will not get this money, becouse it will be spended on the control system. A few years ago there was a scientific work about Hollywood's economic. The results show, that the most important field of economic were selling of pop-corn and Coca-Cola. It practically means that there is no reason for implementing restrictions of distributing copies. 
In conclusion, many people do not believe that it is possible to punish "free-riders", as it will be extremely hard, difficult and expensive to find them at least.

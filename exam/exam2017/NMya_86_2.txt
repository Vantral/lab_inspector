Some people think that producing of food is a main function for every country. Nations should reduse the total amount of imported products. I totally agree with this station, because it is necessary for countries to have their own food products. 
The quality of nutrition has great impact on people's health. Different type of food are exported from many countries. Goods can be failed during a long transportation, for this reason a lot of companies use special medicines or pesticides. For example, farmers make special corn with harmful substances for chicken. Consuquently, birds grow faster and their meat can be saved in refrigerators for a long time. Moreover, this product is a reason for people's illneses. Thus, governments should stopped buying products from another countries and try to start their own producing. 
The independence in economic side is important for every country. The government should provide minimal amount of food for each person. In addition, there are some situations that proved the importance of own producing food for countries. For instance, economic crysic when people need in new job places. In this situation it will be right to build new factories for making food products. In this way, country can avoid critical situations for their economy and allow people to have a job. 
In conclusion, I personally think that every country should improve conditions of producing food. People need to have reliable government, which can help and protect their in every situation.

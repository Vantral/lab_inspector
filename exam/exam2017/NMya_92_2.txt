It is a common thought, what countries should only produce amount of food that own population eats and decrease import of it to a minimum number. This statement is contraversial, but in my oppinion there is a few reasons to disagree with it. 
First of all, by importing food ammount of witch cannot be eaten by population, country can make money to export products wich it desperatly needed. For examle, in Soviet Union huge ammount of bread seed was importing to other countries for exchange to manufactural machines. It caused a lot of deaths by starvation, but that was the only way to overrun technological progress of other countries. Now, as there is no food problem in modern countries, wich import could boost economy of the country. 
Also, some countries will do not have stable income of food and water supplies, such as poor African countries. The only way for them to feed population is to export food in exchange of natural goods, such as oil, gas and others. Decreasing food import from rich countries could be leathal for poor one. 
In addition, country also should have additional food storage in case of some unexpectable issues, wich can be floode, carthoprafes or anythink else. 
To summarise everythink, even though not every single slice of food would be eaten by country population there is no reason to cut its production. Import of food not just make economy stronger, but also can help other countries. Thas is why food production should not be decreased.

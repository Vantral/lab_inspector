The popularity of illegal drugs in the professional sport is growing nowadays. Some people are sure that athletes who got caught using illegal drugs should not be banned from competing for a limited period of time, while others have an opinion that this ban must be permanent instead. In this essay I will discuss both views and give my own opinion. The first point of view is that the ban should remain for a limited period of time. All people can make a mistake and it is very important to be able to forgive others. No doubt that using drugs in sport is unfair and against the rules, the people who do so must be punished. However, banning permanently basicly means crushing the life of such persons, because it prevents them from doing their favourite activity. In comparison, time-limited ban has a big chance to explain the person that using drugs is prohibited and cannot be allowed. The second opinion is more strict and it supposes that sportsmans must be banned forever for using illegal drugs on competitions. This view has its reasons too: in fear of the permanent ban from sports, athlets are less likely to use drugs. Also, with such approach to punishing there is no chance that athletes who were caught once will ever cheat again, because they are not allowed to compete for the rest of their lives. It can be seen that both points of view have their reasons, pros and cons. Personally I think that ban should not be permanent. Limitless in time ban is way more effective, but it is too strict. I am sure that people should be given the second chance, thus the ban is better to remain for a limited period of time.

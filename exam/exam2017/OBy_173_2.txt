It is thought, that widespread of modern technologies causes appearance of new diseases. I totally agree with this statement and I will try to prove it in my essay. 
Several health problems are caused by widespread of modern technology. First of all, it could be some kinds of addictions. For example, computer addiction. Information in the Internet is such interesting and attractive that people cannot log out and return to the real life. Secondly, spending a lot of time in front of computer is followed by problems with eyes. People have to wear glasses to see everything well. Sitting in front of computer may also cause overweight, if you are not moving anywhere. Finally, the content of several web pages could cause psychological problems or ever force people to commit a suicide. 
In my opinion, the number of steps can be made to reduce the negative impact on people's health. To start with, free call centers should be created to help computer adductors. The next step could be improving technology to make them less harmful to health. Finally, should take care about the other kinds of facilities, that could attract people more than computers and mobile phones in their spare time. For example, creation of new cinemas or theatres can be done. 
In conclysion, the effect of modern technology impact significantly depends on personality of people and could be reduced by controlling the usage of modern technology.

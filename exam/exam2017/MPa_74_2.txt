The problems of producing food to the own population of the country and import policy are very pressing and controversual issues nowadays. On the one hand, people believe that country should have minimum import products and produce all the needs by their own. This way of thinking usually have people that live in developing and "the third world" countries. Because globalization that spreads around the world make such countries addicted to a huge international corporations. These corporations integrate in country economics and "kill" small native companies so people start to rely on expensive import products while the national economics falls down. According to that the only way to boost the wellness is to decline import and begin to produce own products. On the other hand, people who live in developed countries have another point of view. Mostly developed countries have a very intensive import and export. Because they produce the product that people are ready to buy around the world and by this way country and corporations make money. According to this they have money to import a high quality products from the other countries. Furthermore, the biggest part of transnational companies are registered in developed countries such as USA, Germany, Japan and so on. So the welness level and the life level at that countries is very high. To sum up, I can't fully agree with one of these two sides because globalization made two types of countries. One of them have a very big problems with national economies, while the other make money just using such countrie just as land for factories and the land to distribute their products. I think that country should have own production but also have a good trade connections with other world. By this way economics wellness of this country would be at high level and also it would have good relationships with that countries which have export and import connections.

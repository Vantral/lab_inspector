The charts below depict transportation of goods in Eastern Europe during 2008. These charts show and give information for comparison of transportation by rail and by road. It is clear that proportion of different types of goods transported by rail is not the same with proportion of goods transported by rail. The first charts shows that there is great proportion of metals (35%) was transported by rail whilst on the second chart this proportion only 11% and the biggest proportion of goods transported by rail is proportion of food (30%). 
However, proportions of some types of goods do not have significant differences. For instance, manufactured good: it is 25 % on the first chart and 28% on the second chart. There is no significant differences in proportions of chemicals either: on the first chat it is 11%, and on the second - 16%. Also, it is necessary to write more about differences of these charts. Proportion of machinery goods transported by rail it bigger than proportion of these good transported by road. 
To conclude, there is some same features in the charts but majority of metals was transported by rail whilst majority of food products was transported by road, not by rail.

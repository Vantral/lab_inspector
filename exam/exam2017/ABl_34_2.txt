Many artists suffer from free internet downloads of their masterpieces, but those who download free music of free films not always are ready to pay for those. So, opinions divide. 
On one hand, those who make the music and films have to earn for their work. The idea of "poor artist" is already ancient today, as more and more people are becoming successful being musicians, actors, directors, painters and so on. Those are jobs which they chose and which are demanded in the society. We know some extremely rich artists, but how much of artists in the whole world are trying to make the ends meet? Probably, one of the reasons is leaks of their products, so that they are becoming free. For instance, we always know how much it would have earned if everyone who watch it paid. 
On the other hand, Bono from U2 said that art should be free. Can we cell and buy masterpieces, or art is more valuable than all the money in the world as it makes us more beautiful inside? Can we make a world where art is a value more money-dependent by charging money for art? Also, more rational argument is that musicians earn more money by concerts they give and tours they got? But how can people know a new musician without knowing his songs? People will not pay for the songs of those they do not know. So, there won't be so many people on concerts as there are now. Talking about films, they make more money in the first months after the release. After that, only those, who want it in a high definition would buy a DVD, Blue-ray or buy it on the Internet. 
In conclusion, different sides of the conflict think differently. Artists want more money to earn, people want less money to spent. It is clearly seen that free copies on the Internet make less harm than they are thought to. So, probably this situation should not be radically solved.

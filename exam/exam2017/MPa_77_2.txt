There are some persons who means that states should make food for yourself and they shouldn't help another states. And I totally disagree with this opinion. First of all, country sometimes don't have possibility to produce food of every type, for example, poor countries of the Third world. They can't make a good food for their population. It is good when a poor country can produce vegetaments. But that is all what they can. I think it is a big problem when people in poor country can't buy meat because, for examples, cows can't live in South America. Than this country need to import meat from another country. Developing countries need in help of developed countries. For example, Brazil can produce bananas to Russia while Russia can export some meat for Brazil. In this case, Brazil don't need to spend money to produce meat and Russian people can eat bananas from Brazil, because it is easier to buy fruit in Brazil than making it yourself. Secondly, the trade relations make political connections. If reach country helps poor country, poor country will help reach country. For example, in crisis situation can sale bananas for a half-price to Russia until Russia quites crisis situation. Of course, in this case, Brazil will have less money or meat, but after that Russia can help Brazil in hard situation. Another example is war. If Russia and Brazil are politically connected, one of them can help another. Russia can give Brazil some tanks, and Brazil can give more people to russian army. In conclusion, producing food not only for yourself can give a country a lot of benefit. I think importing food to another country helps both sides of trade.

There is an opinion that a lot of athletes use illegal drugs in sport. While some people belived that those athletes should not take part in professional competitions for a limeted period, others think that they should be always banned from competitions. On the one hand, there are some reasons why disqualification should be only for limited period. These athlets have done a lot of work to achieve their goals, become famous, get medals, take part in Olympiad and other pretigious competitions. And one of the reason that they were caught using illegal drugs that these athletes do not take these drugs after they become illegal, but they stayed in their blood for a sometime. For example, there are a lot of situations in sport with the meldoniy. A lot of respected athletes have problem due-to their sport organisation do not tell them that the meldoniy now is illegal and they continue to take it. On the other hand, people, who believe that those athletes should be always banned are also right. Unfortunately, some athletes are not honest persons. They only want to become famous, rich and they choose that way of using illegal drugs. The one of the famous sitiations is about bycicleman Armstrong, who won a lot of competitions and he was an absolute champion in the race in France. He won for about 7 times, set some new records. A lot of children and people were inspired by them. And several time ago laboratory checked his analysis and became clearly that he used illegal drugs. Such athletes do not demonstrate real human abilities and give a chance for a new talanted athletes. Moreover, people, who believed them, are frustrated do not encourage their child to go in the "Big Sport". To sum up, I agree with both views. To my mind the right strategy is to ban these athletes, who caught using illegal drugs at the first time and their sport carier is clear, only for a short limited period, while athletes who were caught again should be banned for the rest of their lives.

The line graph describes the minimum and maximum temperatures in two cities of Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Jeneiro, Brazil, covering a period of a year. 
Ther are several main points that can be clearly seen in the graph. 
The first striking feature is that the temperature in Jakutsk suffers great changes during the year. Starting from almost -40º degrees in January, it rockets up and heats a peak in July with almost 15 degrees. That clearly shows us that it has become about three times warmer than it used to be in the beginning of this period. However, during the period from July to December, the temperature decreases again, ending at the point of about -35º degreese. 
In contrast, the weather in Rio de Janeiro remains rather stable during the whole year. From the point of about 26º in January, it slightly plummets to the lowest point of about 22º in July and recovers again to 25º in December. That shows that the climate in Rio is pretty hot during the whole period. 
Another remarkable feature is that in both cities the difference between maximum and minimum temperature remains quite stable being about 6º. So the climate in both cities doesn't suffer from unexpected weather changes. 
Summing up, the weather in Yakutsk tends to be much colder and unstable, then the weather in Rio de Janeiro, where it stays about the same level for the whole year.

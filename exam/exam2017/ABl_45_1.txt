The graph shows the degrees of unemployment in 5 regions and worldwide in 2014 and 2015. 
Firstly, one can see that the highest degree of unemployment is in the North Africa. It is about 12,5% and it stays stable in 2014 and 2015. The second region with high unemployed population is the Middle East. Although it decreased in 2015, it still stays high. Suprisingly, we can see the growing of unemployment in the European Union. However, in Latin America unemployment decreased, in South Asia it is small and stable. 
Secondly, the dicrease of 1% in the Middle East and in North Amera and the stability of other regions, exept European Union, where, however, therease isn't very big, make the worldwide unemployment rate stable at 5,9%. The positive sides of it are the appearance of new jobs and solution of labour problem in developing regions - the Middle East, Latin America and South Asia. However, the minuses are the stability of high unemployment in one of the poorest regions in the world - North Africa and the growing unemployment in different countries. 
To sum up, the little changes in unemployment rate in certain regions don't affect the worldwide rate, although these regions cover big parts of the world.

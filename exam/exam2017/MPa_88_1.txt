Then, both temperatures have a tendency of rising, finally reaching a peak of just over than 10°C and around 25°C for min and max temperatures, respectively. After that the minimum and maximum temperatures start to decrease, reaching a bottom in December. The value for former is -40°C precisely, whereas the latter shows just under -30°C. The graph for Rio de Janeiro has several contrast tendencies. To begin with, it should be mentioned that the temperatures remain roughly stable during the whole period. However, there is a slow decline which begins in February and finished in July with the lowest temperatures, namely about +18°C for min temperature and exactly 20°C for maximum one. After that there is a tendency of temperatures of levelling out.

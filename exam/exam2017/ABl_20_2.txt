Nowadays musicians and film producers have a real problem with copying and sharing their products. This problem influence not only producers but also usual citizens and people who want to get an original discs and other product. 
In my opinion, this type of spread information should be punished. The first reason for it, that companies lost their profit and can lost a motivation to create a quality product, which can be produce in the market. Secondly, the big musicial companies lossing the right over their product after that can be problem with 55 other organizations for original. Companies can have a differences in the end they must go to the judge, actually it can be bad for reputation, and it can lose money which thy can to provide for new project. Thirdly, if company have a bad reputation on the market which means that actors and musicians would not to bound their career with this. Thy cannot be sure that their product will be full present for the audience. because it is if the part of film will be download before the day of premier, the rang of company dramatic decrease. The most popular example which can be presented to show how scandal about shows Sherlock, the epizod was download in the Internet before two days, some people could see this epizod before all world. It was bad for two chanels which provided show because the direct of show can lost their trust to the other side for can be influence on people. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that people who spread and sharing illegal pirate copies should be punished because their activity impact in both side companies lost profit and trust from other organization and people. People lost an opportunity to get a good product.

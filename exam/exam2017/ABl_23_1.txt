We are given a graph which shows us the level of unemployement in different regions of the world. We are provided with data about North Africa, Middle East, the European union, Latin America, South Asia in 2014 and 2015. 
It is seen that situation is stable as there is no huge decrease or increase of numbers. Nevertheless, it can be noticed that in the Middle East and in Latin America columns, which are about unemployment rate in 2015, have become lower: the decrease was from 11 to 9,6 in the Middle East, and the gap between numbers in Latin America is 1%. The situation is getting worse only in one region (the EU) as column has grown since 2014. It can be connected with migration crisis. The highest level of unemployment can be found in the North Africa (12,5%), but it is still at the same level. The best situation is in the South Asia, where it is only 3,9% unemployment. The average number of unemployment rate is about 5,9% worldwide.

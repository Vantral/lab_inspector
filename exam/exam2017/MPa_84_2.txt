Nowadays, modern society believes that it is nessessary to consume only that things, that are produced in your country and try to decrease the import for other parties in the world. I do not totally agree to this extent. Firstly, not all people have opportunities to travel around the world and taste different kitchens. So if there are no food, which are exported from neighbour regions, in their location, they will never know what do people eat abroad. This is about special dishes which every country has. For example, Italy is popular by delicious pasta, France is quitely known for frog legs. If country balanced the levels of export and import it will lead to changing the kitchen traditions over the world. Moreover, our life will so boring if we eat only Russian food. It is obviously, that sometimes everyone of us would like to try something new, for example spicy food from Korea. If there is no examples, no restaurants where it can be eaten, people will search the receipts in the Internet, but every dishes have some specific steps which are known only by local chefs. So it should be mentioned, that when we have an access to all variety of food, we can widen our taste imagination and there are no broadens to choose every that you want. It is a question of self-freedom. All things considering, it can be said that exported food helps us to know other cultures and their traditions through trying their production. From my point of view it is not logically to limit import. We need to share our production for all citizens in the Earth. I'm quite shure that there are an enormous amount of people who really like Russian food.

There are a lot of people who believe that all countries should produce some food only for their country, for their people and countries all over the world should not use import programmes or use import a little time. I disagree with the statement, In my opinion countries should produce products not only for own population but also for another countries. Firstly, import give a lot of advantages for countries all over the world. It is good for economy of countries and it help poor countries to live. For example, now in the reason of political some countries cannot export or import products. Therefore, these countries import a little and they have less amount of money for this reason. Secondly, there are some countries which have no opportunities for producing some food. For example, Russia cannot grow some vegetables, fruites because of climate of the country and Russia export these products from other countries. Russia have a good choice on the market of products because of countries which grow needed products and which aim to import as more as possible. Now for political reasons Russia cannot import and export products in some countries. As a result, our country have a higher prices on fruits, vegetables, cheese and etc. To conclusion, it is important to say that import is significantly important for all countries all over the world. It give countries a chance to have on the market of products a great variety of food with lower prices and import with export help countries in economic sphere.

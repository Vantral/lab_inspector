The problem of the use of illegal drugs in sport is a global and one of the main problems in sport community. For instance on such big competition like Olympic Games. The punishment for the use of illegal drugs in sport is controlled by reglament of the competition. But some people think that athlets cought using illegal drugs should be banned from comptiting professionally for a limited period. This opinion seems to be quite right because the period of influence illegal drugs on a sportsmen is not so long. In addition, the athlete which was caugh using illegal should be lose the score of the last competition and maybe 2 last competitions. On the other hand other people think that such athletes should be banned from from competing professionally for the rest of their lives. I think that this opinion is absolutely wrong because people who think so are not competend and banning from competing professionally for the rest of live is very strict punishment. I think that we should respect the athlets and a understand wrightly the use of illegal drug in sport. We all remember the conflict on the Paralimpic Games in 2016 when the Russian team was can't to take part in competiton. This situation illustrates the wrong position of enterpretation of the use of illegal drugs and illegal blame of russian sportsmens. To sum up I would like to say that the use of illegal drugs must be punished but not by such strict metthod like banning athletes from competing professionally for the rest of their lives. Maybe banning for a limited period (eg 2 years).

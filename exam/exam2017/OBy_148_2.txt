There is an opinion that countries in the world should produce as much food as their population is needed and shouldn't import a lot. I absolutely disagree with this extent and in this essay I'll try to prove my point of view. 
Firstly, all of us live together on the Earth and we should help each other. But I don't talk about gifts or presents to other countries, I mean economics, Different countries produce different goods. Food is one of the most important part of trading and producing. But technologies such as modern computers and medicines are important too. While ones invent new machines, others plant food. It ca be really difficult for one country to produce enough food and enough other goods for all population. That's why it would be better to import some food and to get some medicines, for example. 
Secondly, the size of countries varies. As for Russia it has amount of ground to plant food. Also different climates in some parts mean that a lot of types of food can be plain there. But there is a little territory in Japan, for example. They can't produce enough food because of the size of their country. As for population it's more than in Russia. Without buying food from other countries it will be hard to exist. That's why it will be great if countries with big territories import their food. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that producing food not only to population of your country helps a lot to other countries and your own one.

That is a well-known fact that some people think the food production countries should be oriented to their own population only and it should minimize import from countries abroad. On the one hand, due to local production of food goverment can stimulate businesses, firms and factories to provide country with goods and services. As a result, quality of goods will become better because of local firm competitiveness. Moreover, transportation among country will be cheaper and it will lead to price reduction. But on the other hand, there are some negative effect of local production only. First of all, climat situation is not allow to grow some type of goods in certaint regions. For example, people in Finland cannot grow up olive trees. Besides, when country refuse to import, it faces a disability of exchange of rare items with other countries. In conclusion I would like to say that I strongly disagree with the opinion that country should produce food only for its population. I suppose that the processes of export and import give a chance for countries to get in the economic success and to reach lots of financial and social benefits from exchange with other countries. Also it is important to notice that due to goods and services exchange among countries citizens will be allowed to get closer to other country culture, its food and lifestyle. Furthermore, some developing countries will appreciate supporting from other countries as they cannot provide food for all population by their own production only.

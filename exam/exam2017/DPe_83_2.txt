I disagree with the idea that copying and sharing music or films on the Internet should be punished. 
Speaking about social problems it is a fact that not everyone can allow to buy themselves original discs of music or films. We are all equal and our interests in world arts shouldn't be bounded by money and our social cast. There are many talented poor people who could be inspired by cinema or music masterpieces.

Nowadays, there are a lot of different opinions towards the question wheather it is necessary to produce food for the citizens of one's own country or it is more convinient to import them from abroad. As for me, I believe that we should concentrate on our own production that is why. First of all, as we all know, producing food which means breeding seeds, vegetables and agricultural products gives us a working force. For example, people who work on their own farms and factories must pay taxes for their sold production. This allows the government to make a budget for the next year, and if we will replace our own production by the foreign one where will we take money to pay for it? Another very important reason to limit import is the quality of production. In many countries agriculture firms tend to produce a more high quality for their own consuming instead of trading it. Moreover, there are a lot of extra pays for imported products such as, for example, butter. Even we sometime have to pay more for the widely-known brand of the product. To sum up, I would like to say that nowadays, living in a globalized world, contries build trade relationships and it is very necessary to trade, there is no doubt, but to my opinion we should concentrate on our own production, because food is one of the most important staff that we acquire and we should to the food firstly for our own society even sometimes limiting import.

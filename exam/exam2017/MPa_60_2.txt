It is believed that a nation should produce only that kinds of good that are consumped by it, and import should be limited. From my point of view, such opinion is rather wrong. Opponents of open bourders and unlimited import and export claim that every country has an ability to produce the food that is needed by its population. However, such argument doesn't count that some countries are non-agrucultural and their specification is to produce, for instance, machinery. More important, such differencies allow countries to produce something more effectively and then export it in other countries from which they can import something else, that they cannot produce because of lack of resourses. Moreover, we should not forget the historical examples. For example, USSR aimed to produce only for itself and failed. When one nation tries to make a plan of production it usually cannot count a variety of factors and preferences of people. Taking all these points into account, it should be mentioned that arguments of proponents of theory that country needs to produce foo only for itself are not valid. Countries with such system usually do not have enough resources to satisfy all the needs of their own population. Therefore, in my opinion, countries shoud have a freedom to produce all they want and all they can afford.

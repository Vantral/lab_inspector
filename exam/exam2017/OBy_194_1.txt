The piechart illustrates the transportation of goods by rail and road in Easter Europe countries in 2008. 
Overall, the largest group of transported by rail are metals - 35%, while food products are preferred to transport by road more than other goods. 
The quarter of goods transported by rail includes manufactured goods. Food products and chemicals are in equal proportion - 11% and 12% of rail transportation contains machinery. The smallest part of the piechart includes non-metallic minerals. 
If we look at the chart of transportation by road in detail we can see that the largest group after food products is manufactured goods - 28%. In contrast to rail, it is more convenient to transport chemicals and non-metallic minerals by road - 16% and 13% versus 11% and 6% of the first chart. The proportion of machinery is the smallest - just 2%, that is why we can say that machinery is preferred to transport by rail.

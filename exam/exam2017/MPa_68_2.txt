Nowadays the argues about production of food became extremely popular. Many people think that countries should produce only local food and don't use import goods. Other claim that import is very imporatnt for economys. First of all, I should mention that we live in the age of globalization, that's why some cultural traditions spreaded all over the world. For example, pizza is one of the most popular meal ever and a lot of people only in Italy like it. Why should it be prohibited? I think, it's a question of national identity because for many people is important to eat the same dishes which their parents had. That's the reason why idea of Nikita Chhrutschev failed - he wanted to start grown a corn, which was very popular in America -, but local people didn't want to eat this, because it wasn't their own food. On the other hand, for many people there is no big deal to try new experiences in food. But the question of import is quite the serious one, because good economy should be independent from import but not quit global market at all (as North korea did). Furthermore, population of country might be so different. For example, in the United states there are more than twenty nations and they eat completely different food, which can't be grown in the USA so the government doesn't have target to reduce market. All in all, in my opinion, it is not right idea to reduce the level of import as much as possible, because globalization opened "the global market" for us and we can taste any food in the world and it would be strange not to use this opportunity.

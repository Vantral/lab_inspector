The pie charts below provide the data about the goods transported across the countries in the year 2008. The first chart gives the information about rail road transportation, while the second one gives details on road transportation. Overall, most of the goods can be transported by both ways. 
Firstly, metals are transported more often by rail than by road, while non-metallic minerals are twice more often transported by road. Manufactured goods follow the same pattern in rail and road transportation: 25 % and 28 % apparently. Secondly, one third of rail transportations are taken by food. Roads are not usually used to transport machinery. Such transportations take 12% of rail transportations. 
All in all, some goods are transported only by road and rail, while others take the same proportion of rail and road transportations.

Nowadays, people can download music and films on the Internet but musicians and film producers lose their money because of it. Some people think that downloading films and music should be punished. Others disagree with them giving their arguments. As for me, I completely agree with those who against punishment for sharing music or films on the Internet. 
Now, almost everything became available on the Internet and I think that it is a positive trend that shouldn't be punished. Firstly, people spend their money on cinemas and musical concerts. That is why musicians and film producers gain very large amounts of money and they wouldn't become poor if people could listen to music or watch their films for free in some ways. Moreover, there are people who hasn't so much money to spend it on music and films but with the help of Internet they have an apportunity to watch movies and listen to some songs. 
Secondly, I think that people should avoid punishment for sharing and downloading files on the Internet because it is hard to find such criminals. Policy should interfere into user's private life but such actions can't garanter that policy won't make mistackes. Furthermore, they can punish not criminals. I can edd that such undemocratic actions can lead to people's hostility and outrange to government. 
Taking everything into account I can state that it isn't justly to punish people who only want to watch films and listen to music. Musicians and producers should understand that they have very huge amounts of money in comparison with ordinary people.

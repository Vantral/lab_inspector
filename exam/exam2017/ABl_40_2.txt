The topic of illegal copying of films and music over the last time became very debatable and lots of controvercial points of view are mentioned. Some people think, that producers, lose their fair money, that is why people, who cope, must be punished. Others believe that there is not the point. 
The supportes of first position usually gives an examples of comparison between thieves, who can steel films and break the law as well. Why do we punish the first group of people and ignore The second one? These number of people believe that it could lead to a "death" of cinema as a way of spending your freetime and meeting with your friends, because you can stay at home and watch a moovie. 
The critics of punishment speak about the disability of comparison the crime like steeling something and pirate copying: the rate is the same. Moreover, it is very hard to bring some evidence and find a criminal, so it will only lead to overdealing among policemen. Well, to point out my own position I can say that nowadays the industry of cinema and music is transitioned into the internet area it is really convenient to stay at home and listen to music, for instance. All in all, despite this fact pirats break the rules and need to pay some money for it, but not be taken into prison. 
In conclusion, we need to claim that government should think about the ways of making it easier for people to post music and films in the internet, as this industry is developing everydays. Legal ways sometimes are too costly, that is why all done illegaly. No matter if these changes will be done or not, there are differnt points of view on this issue.

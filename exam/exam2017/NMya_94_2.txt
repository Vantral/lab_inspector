Many persons think that all countries must produce just for own population and don'd import it. It is very nessesary and difficult problem. And I will try to analyse it. 
This quastion have positive and negative points, so it is hard to say that this idea is right or wrong. But I will analyse two sides of this quastion. At first, economic of countries, which export the food, very influenced by other countries, which import the food. And if one country stop to import some goods from exporter country, then economic of this country will decrease. But it is may not influence on importer country. I think this solution may be positive for economic situation of this country. 
But this idea has other side. I think that it is possible to say about two nessesary negative aspects of this solution. One of this aspects is problems of country, when it can't produce many food, that their own population eats. It can be involved with climat or other reason. So, importing the food is the one possible solution for this countries. Other negative aspect is possible influencing on friendship between two countries. And consiguanters will be negative. It is also big problem, becouse it will can involve to importing country in the future. But I sure that this negative outcome can be not nessesary, if importer stop import during some time. 
To sum up, I sure, that this idea can be alive and also some countries may follow it. But goverments of this countries must understand that this stategy will make some negative outcomes.

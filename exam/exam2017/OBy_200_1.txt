The pie charts demonstrate the comparison between the amount of goods, transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. 
It is obvious, that the majority of goods, which are moved by rail, is metals. When the most transported goods by road are food products. 
Looking at the charts in more details, we can see that manufactured goods are transported both by rail and by road with the percentage of 25% and 28%. The same trend is with chemicals, the amount of them moved by rail and by road is almost the same. 
In contrast, there is a significant difference in the range of machinery, 2% of which is transported by road and 12% is moved by rail. The noticeable difference of 7% can be mentioned in the amount of non-metallic minerals. 
All in all, the main ideas are that people prefer to transport metals by rail and food by road, while they can use both methods to move manufactured goods.

Internet is the significant pat of our lives today. We can do great things through the web like education, shopping, connection etc. But also do crimes. On of the most discussed problems is an illegal content copying. Developers lose their money and no one could be punished. 
To my mind, the problem is not as big as it is supposed to be. Authors still has their money from sells. They do not think that person who steal content today may like it and buy it tomorrow. People should not be punished for downloading pirate copies. It is hard to blame them for saving money. Especially in Russia where legal copies of films and video games cost too much comparing with average revenues. 
It is useless to ban pirate sources because I know at least one perfect way to decrease illegal copying. A lot of people use services like Apple Music or Spotify. They allow to listen music for small pay every month with speciel offers for students. So did Netflix, HBO, Amedia. They created striming services with huge amount of TV-series and films for 10 dollors per month that millions of internet users forgot about their PirateBay accounts. So the answer is not to punish people but make the offer which will make them to refuse from illegal copying. 
Modern technologies like smartphones, tablets, Wi-Fi and mobile Internet allows developers and companies to create and sell content accordingly to auditory's requests and they shoul use their possibilities. Judging everyone is complected and expensive process.

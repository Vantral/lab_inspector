There is an opinion that contries have to produce only the food that their people eat and should not Import it at all or just a small amount. In modern world it is one of the hot topics and it seems that solution hadn't been found yet. 
I strongly believe that country shoud produce all the food that a population need inside itself. It would be good for country companies because people will buy only their food and there will not be any concurents from the outside of the country. The food will always be fresh because it will not need a long journey from one side of the world to another. 
The second reason is that only that person who lives in the same country knows what people are get used to or simply love. For example, only a person from South Korea knows how to make kimchi very delicious. and when you try it in Korea and then get back to Russia and go to one of the Korean restaraunts you will not find the same taste unless the chef is from South Korea. With a lot of surweys food companies are gaining knowledge about our preferences and producing food that will fit them. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that even if we are fond of foreign food we shoud eat it in their origin countries where it will be cooked for us by the correct way of cooking and from the freshest products.

From the beginning of globalization era peoples of the world have been living in a growing mutual influence and cooperation. This fact implies an increase in international trade as well, which has had a positive impact on import and export rates of many countries. However, some people claim this policy undermines national souvereignity of a country assuming that there no point in producing more than its population needs as well as in importing goods. Personally, I am inclined to believe that trading is a rather significant instrument in countries' economic regulations on the grounds that some countries are not able to afford various products due to the lack of resources. Furthermore, if one can produce so much food that there is a possibility to sell it abroad, why does not he or she do that? Another argument in favor of this idea can be the water loss in Africa, where children would have no water to drink, if developing countries did not supply the suffering regions by needed quantity. Thus, provided that we think objectively, it would not be an exaggeration to suppose that an idea of protectionism is not a relevant one, since it does not take into account a world of details.

The pie charts show the percentage of goods delivered by rail and by road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008. 
To begin with, the product transported by road are the same than transported by rail. In the first pie chart we can see 35% of metals transported by rail whereas there are only 11% of metals delivered by road. In the bot charts we can see about the same number of manufactured goods (25% and 28%). Machinery is mostly transported by rail (12%), when delivery by road is only 2%. However, food products mostly delivered by road (30%). Non-metallic minerals (13%) transported by road and it is half-higher than transportation by rail. Transportation of chemicals in both charts is pretty the same. 
Overall, the percentage of manufactured goods are the same level in both pie charts. Metals and machinery delivered by rail mostly. Whereas food product is beneficially transported by road.

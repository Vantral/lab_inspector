Some people think that export of food is not really important for their country and they must not produce food for it, while concentrating on food that own population eats. I do not think so. I believe that every country should export food if it can and import if they need it. 
Firstly, export of food is a buisiness. Country would get money if they sell food to other countries. It is important part of budget of many developing contries. If there are a chance to plant an additional field of corn and earn money for it, the government should do it. Secondly, some countries simply cannot produce as much food as they need. It is very important for those countries to import food from others. If noone would export food people can die without it. Thirdly, it is important to produce more food than your country can eat because of different accedent and wether anomalies. If you produce as much food as you need and some of your food will be damaged by long rains or long time without them, you simply cannot provide population of your country with food. 
People who have opposing view says that it is bad for development of country to spend so much resources on producing of food. They believe that this people can help in other places, instead of working in the fields. I partly agree with them. A lot of people all over the world work mannaly in food manufacturing. But I do not think that is is a reason to reduce production of food. Scientists and engineers must develope a project to reduce human workers in food production. This is the only way to reduce number of workers in this sphere. 
In conclusion, I can say that it is important to develop food expert to earn money and help other countries. But the food production sphere must be upgraded.

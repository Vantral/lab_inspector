The chart below shows changes in unemployment rate in selected world regions in 2014 and 2015. Some of the countries, such as North Africa and South Asia, illustrate a stable position of unemployment level. Also, as we can see, the overall level of unemployement around the world has not changed during that year. The chart falls from 11% to 9,6% and from 6,8% to 5,8% in Middle East and Latin America respectively. However, the situation in European Union is described with the opposite statistics: the quantity of unemployed people rose from 7,5% to 7,9%. In conclusion, we can see that despite minor changes in different regions, the worldwide number of unemployed stays the same. Surprisingly, the rate in Europe countries increased, despite those countries are highly industrially developed.

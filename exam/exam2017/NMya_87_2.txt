There is an opinion that countries should produce only the food that their nation eats and by that reduce the import as much as possible. I do not agree with this statement and and I would like to express my opinion. 
The first obvious reason to tend to import more foreign food is the better meal variety of citizens. This factor can lead to better productivity and happiness of average citizen. Moreover most people are open-minded about trying something new in their life and food is no exception. With high posibility this desition, which was stated before, will be supported by anyone. the second reason about importing more food comes from the medical point of view. There is a high posibility that local food does not contain enough minerals and nutrients to supply the body. This may result in problems with health, which lead to higher chance to get ill, reduction of average lifespan and so forth. This is why it is so important to have a wide variety of food available in all supermarkets. Last, but not least argument is that reducing the amount of import will significantly harm the economy. it is clear that this trade between countries would have only positive impact on both countries which participate in it. The foreign seller which perhaps has high supply of his national food, is able to balance it by selling it our country. Our country also has sort of income because buying food from other countries is probably cheaper to produce it by yourself. Thus it is a win-win situation. 
Summing up, I would like to mention that lowing production of local food and increasing import of it will no doubt have a positive impact on every single attribute of modern life and can also improve the economy.

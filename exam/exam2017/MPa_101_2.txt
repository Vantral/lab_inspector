Some individuals think that coverment of all countries should make foor for their citizens only and they believe that contries have to reduse an amount of food which import. I completely disagree with this statement because I think it have bad influence to the world's economy. It is common knowlage that population of our world is rapidely go up and the number of poore people go up to. Because of it we need to produce as large amound of food as possible to give any human aportunity to eat enough. For example, we can see bad situation around food market in poor countries because the goverment of these countries have no apportunity to make enough amount of food and people of these states are in bad situation. On the other hand, I believe that industrial countries can help people around the world by producing food. We know that Unated Nations spends billion dollars to provide food in poor regions on our world such as Siria, Libia and many countries of the Africa. Unated Nation can help people, for example, to refugees only with supporting of industial countries like United States, Russia and China. In additional, if these countries starts produse as little food as possible prices will rase and supporting reduce. As we know, if we economy starts to reduse supply by goverment regulation prices are go up and markets cannot reach sustanable point. Goverman regulation provide many different types of problems for economy, because of in markets should be opened and free. To sum up, if economy of country can produce big amount of food it have to do it.

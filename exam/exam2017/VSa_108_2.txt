There are many conversations about sports nowadays, especially about its drug-problems. Some tend to believe that sportsmen should be banned from competing professionally for some limited time period. Others want such athletes to be banned permanently. There are surely some serous arguments to support each of the positions. 
It's crucial to understand that some people come into sports only due to the love for the competition or the athletic practice itself. Banning them for some time may help them to realize what they can actually lose if they don't stop their illegal actions. Moreover there are usually coaches responsible for giving them a medicine, so banning athlete permanently may simply ruin his life for no reason, while the real guilty person walks free. 
On the other hand it's silly to deny, that such drugs affect organism in the permanent manner. Some affections may be harmful and some may give drugtaking athletes some advance. So letting those people compete again may be dangerous for their lives causing some accidents during the competition or simply dishonest. There is also a meaning, that the main factor in taking drugs is actually cheating. The person, who cheated once, is not likely to be trusted again later. 
To sum up, there is no certain way of dealing with such a controversial question, as both positions present rather convincing arguments, which have to be studied more closely. In my opinion, the choice, whether the athlete should compete again later or not is only up to him. The positive affection on their body may actually be present, but not in the way those sportsmen would become unbeatable, so it isn't actually cheating. We cannot take anyone's dream away just in order to punish him for misstepping once. That's not what our society is standing for.

Nowadays, in the conditions of global markets, food commodities are imported and exported internationaly. However there are those who still think that, speaking about food self-sufficiency, countries should be as much in depended as possible. In my opinion, this is not true. Firstly, the international trade and global division of labor make the production process much cheaper for every country. There fore, country that is involved in global market can rise its incomes and improve its economic situation. For example, Singapure is imported there from other places. Hence, the economy of this country is one of the most stable economies of the world. Secondly, for many countries with severe weather conditions global trade can be a decision that can solve their problems because such countries can import a lot more products than they could possibly produce. In instance, some parts of the world like very dry and hot regions of Asia and Africa or regions with constantly low temperature are unable to produce food to cover the needs of its citizens. Therefore, importing food products can be a great solution. All in all, in my opinion it is evident that food importing and exporting can solve many problems that different countries face nowadays all over the world: from the expenciveness of the food production to the lack of the farmland with good soil and severe weather conditions.

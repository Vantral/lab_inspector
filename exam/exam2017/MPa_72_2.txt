Some people believe that thier country should produce the food which eat population of thier country. They suppose, that import is a bad idea, so the country should aim to import only a little part of all production. I absolutely disagree with this point of view and will try to explain why I think the other way. To my mind every country must import a large part of food it produce, because this way it has a money. Every product has it's cost, so if you seel the goods, you will have a profit. I don't know no one powerful country, which don't sell its products out. Without this money, the country cannot develop in the right side. It is obvious, that the part of the country budget list should be import. Also, every country should have balance between import and export. There is no country, which produce every goods better than others. So, each country shoul concentrate on the list of food, which it produce better. This food need to provide own population and the other part of it should be import. and the products, which country produce worse, should be bought from the other countries. This is their way to keep balance between import and export. For example, Brazil produce coffee better than others, so it shoud aim to import a large part of it, but they cannot do good meet, so Brazil buy it from countries which do it better. This way people from the country will use the better products, than if the country aim to import as little as possible products. Finally, I would like to say that the right balance of import and export is the way to become a powerful country. So, it is useless aim to import as little product as possible.

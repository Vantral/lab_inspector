Nowadays, a lot of professional athletes start using illegal drugs and some people think that such sportmans should be banned from competing professionally for a limited perioud. By contrast, the others believe that such athletes must be banned until the end of their life. Both views shoud be discussing before comming to a definite conclusion. It is useless to deny that professional athletes shoud stop their career for a limited perioud because they can realize that using illegal drugs doesn't worth the win on the different competition and stop using it. It is also true that such athletes can feel all negative effects such as reduce the level of G-force or decrease the power of muscules from illegal drugs and then, they decided to never use any kind of drugs again. There are a considerable support for the notion that all athletes who use illegal drugs, must be banned for the rest of their lives because it's not a serious problem for them to continue using drugs (naturally do it more carefully). Moreover, such athletes can motivate the youth that only drugs help them to win in every kind of sports. It is absolutely true that sportmans who prefer to use illegal drugs must be banned until the end of their careers, because the feel that you become a winner outweigh all disadvantages, in particular, ban for a limited perioud. In conclusion, it is definitely true that unfair sportmans, using illegal drugs, must go out from sport, and it's not important how many achievement they already got.

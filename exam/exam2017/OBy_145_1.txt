That line graphs a illustrating Average temperatures in Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro. This line graphs have many different, in Yakutsk temperature are alvays change from winter to summer and from sumer to winter. Temperature have big amplitude, because Yakutsk is located in central sudiria that mean it is too far From ocean. So ocean cant give energy in winter, but do not tak in summer. So temperature are going from -40*C to 25*C. Easy to calcylete medium temperatyre - -10*C - 15*C. 
Other situation in Rio de Janeiro, Braszil. Rio is located in America, they have mountines and ocean, it is mean temperature will not have too much changes as Yakutsk. But minimum in the summer and maximum in winter because other half of Earth. Medium temperature is 25*C. 
I would like to live in Rio, if I have a choise. But I need to talk about the lowest temperature in Yakutsk, it is -40*C. I don't know how people live here, but it is unpossible.

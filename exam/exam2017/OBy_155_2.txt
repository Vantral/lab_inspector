A lot of people like to eat vey different food from other countries, but there are some of them who think, that their own countries should produce food for their own population and import not so much of it. 
As for me, I can't agree with this statement. I think, that all countries should produce the food as for their population ad for import in different countries as much as possible. Firstly, not every country stands in good economical situation, so, they should increase import food or something else abroad, and sell it for biggest price then in their own countries. Secondly, there are some countries, which produce not so many kind of food or does not produce it. So, how such a countries can stand not in crysis, that is why more developed countries must share their food product with others. It will help both countries: which import will earn money, while another can buy food and decided their own people,. 
Thirdly, it is really comfortable, because you can eat what you want, you just need to go to the supermarket and buy, for example strawberries in winter, which were imported from Thailand or somewhere else. In addition, it is right to help less developed countries, because your country can import them food, when they can produce and import something useful for your country. 
In conclusion, I would like to say, that every human has their own opinion, but governments have to make right decisions, which will help their countries to make a stable economical situation. That is why many countries should import food as much as possible

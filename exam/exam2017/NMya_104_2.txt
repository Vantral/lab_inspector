Nowadays, a part of people think, that every country must produce the food only for humans, who live in this country, and countries must try to stop import food as it possible. I think it's not a good idea, and I tottally disagree with that Firstly, every country has a territory, it's obviusly, and another countries can't use this territory for their aims. But sometimes people of some country cant produce the food, because of weather, type of ground and some other factors. This countries has another products for sale, and they must buy food from another countries, it's necessary to survive. If all countries will stop import, a lot of people may die. 
Secondly, some countries can produce only food and it's meen that they must buy another products from another countries. It's normal, because it's good for every country. And this is good for economic, because country need money always. In addition, it's good for national relationships. 
Thirdly, I cant see reasons don't do that, everybody need it: the people, the goverment, the people and the goverment of another countries. People must help another humans, it is one of the basicly instinct of survive. 
Generally speaking, I think countries must produce and import food as much as it possible, because it is money for this country and normal life for people from another country. Some countries can survive only with help and it is so important try to help to another country and no reasons not to do that

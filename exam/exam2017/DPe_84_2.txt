Since the internet has appeared and after some years of its development it became an everyday practice for users to find and download films and music for free. But they forget that these files are illegal copies, and creators of original ones lose a lot of money because of it. There were a lot of tryings to find a way, how to stop downloading of pirate copies in global web, but all of them were unsuccesfully. 
There is a huge opinion that sharing illegal copies of films and music should be punished. Firstly, because of great financial losts which it causes. Most people sure that paying a huge amount of money to creators or locking in jail for a long period will stop people from copying files. But, it seems to me, this practice will be failed. First of all, there are millions of people who downloading illegal copies from the web everyday. It is quite impossible to find and punish everyone. Even if government would try to find just those people who download it, it seems to be unsuccessfull too. My opinion that the best way of solve this problem is giving people an opportunity to have an access to films and music for quite little payment. There a lot of examples nowadays, how it works. ITunes or Netflix give an access to their users, but ask them for a small annual or monthly fee. So, audience can watch films and serials, listen to music, and don't have a great losts in money. Also, because of growing audience of this services, authors and creators have their money too. 
In conclusion, there is no doubt that it's important to stop sharing pirate versions of files on the Internet. But punishment is not the answer, and there are another ways of solving a problem.

The world trade is quite controversial topic nowadays. It suggests, that countries should make and sell those goods (in this case food) that are easier for them to produce. However, some people believe that it is better to produce only the food, which their own population needs. I cannot agree with them. Trade in general reduces poverty and enables better nutrition. First of all, in many cases it is more beneficial to import some food, for example grains and meat, than produce it, because other country has more facilities to grow that and so can sell it with lower price. If food is cheaper, more people in the country-importer can afford it. Then, if people do not spend their energy and capital to produce some unbeneficial foo, they can spend it to grow something which they can sell. In that way people actually will gain more than otherwise. For instance, when Russian government made a decision to reduce import and produce more locally, the prices rose and the whole well-being of nation became worse. Some people might argue, that local farmers will loose farm trade, because they will not be able to compete with foreign sellers. But those farmers always can reconsider their production and start to grow something else, which can be sald abroad or cannot be imported. All in all, the world trade is the good way to make everyone better, to increase wealth and redus poverty, because it increase performance of production.

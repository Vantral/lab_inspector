The graph shows that Facebook is the most popular social network among every age group, hence it is more widely used by adults in general than Instagram and LinkedIn. People from 18 to 29 tend to use these networks more than 65+ adults, as only Facebook users aged 18-29 compose 87% of that age group, while 65+ users get only 84% of we summarize their numbers for all networks, assuming that different people of that age group are registered in every site. LinkedIn is the least popular network among people from 18 to 29, but for the rest 3 groups the situation changes as LinkedIn has got 2nd place among them while the least popular site is Instagram. For both Facebook and Instagram the usage falls as the age group rises, but that is not true for LinkedIn which is more popular among middle age groups like 30-49 and 50-64.

We can see two multiple line graphs displaying the average temperatures between minimum and maximum of two cities: Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. 
First graph shows us the rise and fall of temperature in Yakutsk, Russia within a year. Second graph shows not great changes of temperature in Rio de Janeiro within a year too. Comparing the graphs we can notice that temperature in Yakutsk has more changes than in Rio de Janeiro. 
The graph that describes temperature changes in Yakutsk displays a rapid increase of both minimum and maximum temperature from -40 degrees in minimum up to approximately 11 degrees in minimum in period of half a year (January - July). Maximum temperature in this period raised from minus 35 degrees up to 24 degrees. Second period of time (from July to December) approximately mirrors the left part of a graph. With changes from 11 degrees to -40 degrees in minimum and from 24 degrees to minus 34 degrees in maximum. 
Second graph shows that the temperature in Rio de Janeiro slightly falls from January to July and then increases back to usual temperature up to December. Maximum temperature in this city doesn't drop less than 25 degrees and doesn't raise more than 30 degrees. Minimum temperature doesn't fall less then 18 degrees and doesn't increase more than 24 degrees.

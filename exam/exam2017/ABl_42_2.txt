Large musical labels and cinema companies suffers from the pirates activity losing enormous sums of money, so that is nothing to wonder about, when they do call for punishment of those, who share their production illegally and those, who download such files for free. But I definitely disagree with such position and I'll explain why. 
Firstly, free information sharing is a very important factor in a cultural development as for every particular person, as for society as an infity. By watching for listening to products discussed we obtain huge material for analyzing and reflecting. We may become emotionally fulfill and we may get a very profound knowledge of who are we and where are we going. Can it be possible to imagine our world without Beatles? Weren't they some kind of a voice of generation common symbol? Yes, they were. And was imagine what would happen, if access to their art were hardly restricted, if so-called pirates were punished for such dynamic "illegal" sharing? Would you support such restrictions? 
Secondly, as for as I'm concerned, every artist wants his work to be seen and valued. It is not about money, but about self-expression, self-manifestation if you want to call it 10. And Internet, free sharing, pirates - all mentioned allows creators directly communicate with their potential (and non-potential) authority, with those who could understand them. Capitalist logic of investments and incomes do not work in such case musical label, midue-concernt do act in a role of giant parazyte. 
To conclude; I'll say that free share is a mechanism which helps not only public, but to an author as well. It their needs and ambitions, perfectly and encourages development dynamic of both of them. So if we must choose between general good and pragmatic material interests of firms and companies, I will undoubtly choose the first option.

Some scientists claim that food protectionism, which is a politics aimed to shorten the volume of export and import of food, is an effective politics nowadays. I am of the opinion that in the era of globalisation trade barriers make a lot of harm especially in the food trade. First of all, in the case of the shortage of food because of drought, crops desease or extreme weather conditions the country which tries to reduce import will deal with hunger. Food is one of the most essential goods for a mankind which is why food politics should aim to protect people. Afterwards, in the age of globalisation people do not always prefer food which was originally produced in their region. For instance, people in America consume rice (which was originally grown in China), europeans eat potatoes (which came from America). Although food patterns of behaviour do not depend on the region anymore, there are still some regions which are more suitable for growing coffee (for example Latin America), wheat (Russia) because of the weather conditions. While the specialisation of countries in food production is the most effective way to gain bigger profits, trade barriers and extensive trade regulation are unreasonable in the production and distribution of food. Taking all the information above into consideration, the restriction of food export and import may be dangerous not only for people in the country with such politics but also for other countries where the production of essential food (like corn, rice or wheat) may be more expensive. Nowadays such politics is considered to be highly unprofitable, and it is avoided in the majority of developed and developing countries.

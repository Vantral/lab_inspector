The graphs contain average minimum and average maximum temperature curves based on the measurements which were made in two cities: Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. Most noticeably of all, the shape of the temperature curves in Yakutsk is more convex than in Rio de Janeiro where the shape of the curves looks more similar to a straight line. The gap between the highest and the lowest temperatures during the year in Rio de Janeiro is considerably small, while in Yakutsk maximum temperature curve heats a peak at approximately 25Â°C in July and then plumments to almost 35 degrees below zero in december. In the Nortern hemisphere winter comes in December-February with the temperature fluctuating between 30 and 40 degrees below zero, while at the same time in the Soutern Hemisphere summer comes with the maximum temperature around 30 degrees above zero. In conclusion, average temperature trend in Rio de Janeiro is more steady than in Yakutsk, where a clear upward trend can be seen in the first half of the year and then there can be noticed a downward trend in the second half of the year.

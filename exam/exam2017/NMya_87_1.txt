On the graphs, that are presented here, is reflected the average temperature of Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. On both graphs on the x-axis is shown the month, from January to December, when the measure was taken. The y-axis represents us the temperature, which is described in this grath in Celcius (Â°C), the range is from -50 to 30 degrees with step of 20. The legend tells us that the line that represents the maximum temperature is solid with dots, containing crosses incide, and the other one, which shows the minimum value of the mont, has solid dots and dotted line. 
Both graphs differ from each other. The temperature in Yakutsk starts in January from -40 degrees, then increases significantly to 25 degrees maximum and 10 minimum in July, and then drops bask to -40 and -35 accordingly by the end of the year. The gap between the highest and the lowest temperature does differ too: from January to June is width is about 5 degrees, and after that it norrows down to 2 and a half or so. The other graph is completely different: it has not the highest values at winter and realtively lowest at summer, but that temperature drop is only about 5 degrees. The minimum temperature is lower than the maximum one by 8 degrees throuhout the year. 
These graphs represent two different climates on planet Earth and by comporing them you can see how varying the climate can be. They both are completly different.

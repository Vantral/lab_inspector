The problem of illegal sharing which leads to financial problems of musicians and film producers is very controversial nowadays. Some people think that people who copying and sharing music on the Internet should be punished, others disagree with them and believe that there should be a freedom in this case. 
People who are for punishing provide rather strong arguments for their position. First of all, they believe that copying and sharing is very harmful for the musicians and it can lead to the bad financial situation of the famous person. They should only sell their products. Secondly, they think that sharing can be considered as the ignorance of the rights of an artist. Because sometimes for example film producers have a plan of how to present their film and if someone share the info about the film before the debut it would be disrespectful for the labour of the film producer. 
But there are some people who do not share this point of view. Firstly, they believe that now, when we are living in the post-industrial world we should have the right to copy and share all the information we get. Moreover, they believe that usually when some information about the film shared in the Internet it only has a positive impact on the amount of money which producer get from the film. It help to boost interest in the internet sphere. And finally, they sure that sometimes it is the only way to listen to some new music, or to watch a film because nowadays the price of the cinema ticket is rather high as well as the price of the MP3 disc. 
To sum up, there is no correct answers for this kind of questions because it all depends on the attitude of the person. The position of people who are for the freedom of copying and sharing is closer to my attitude.

Music and film industries loose lots of money annualy because of illigal copying of goods they are producing. These copies are shared in the Internet by ordinary people who does not want to buy original discs. Should be they punished for such actions? 
This issue is quite important in the modern society, where copyright does matter. Some people think that sharing music and films in the Internet without buying it is theft and individuals, that do it, should be punished with taxes and even be inprisoned. Music and films are not for free: musicians and film producers have made them for money and they put huge amounts of time and strengh into implementation their ideas. So, other people must respect a great work of artists, musitians and the whole industries and spend money on goods, such films and music, instead of stealing and sharing it for free. 
However, other people discuss this perspective and say that if we have such a great opportunity to listen to music and watching films via the Internet absolutely for free, so why we have to pay for it. They consider that these peases of art belong not only for producers and artists but for people in common. For example, when great musicians wrote their music, they got money from it but also spreded it among ordinary people. So, many people could get to know the musician. Furthermore, spreading music or films for free around the world could bring a huge population to the artist. 
To sum up, the personal work should be copyrighted. Personally, I agree that people who shared music and films should be punished somehow, but not very strict, as not many users of the Internet are aware of copyright existence and they are used to gain all the things, like films and music, in the Internet without paying any sums of money.

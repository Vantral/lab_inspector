In my point of view, new innovations can be very harmful for human. To begin with, sitting for a long time in your telephone or computer can be very dangerous for eyes. Scientists believe that spend long time watching TV, playing computer games or chatting online in telephone can be harmful for human vision. Moreover, some innovations and new technologies have a high level of radiation.

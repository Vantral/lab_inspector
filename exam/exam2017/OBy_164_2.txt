In our contemporary era of globalization the issue of technologies which has an effect on human's health is sharp as never before. There is a fact that technologies has a harmful effect on the health. But there is a question how this problem might be solved. 
In our everyday life we are connected with a huge amount of technologies which are, on the one hand, make our life easier, but on the other hand, case a lot of problem with our health. So, for instance, we use mobile phones not only for calling, but also for reading books or surfing on different web-sites and social networks. By doing this regullary our eyes become weaker. The same situation is with computers, which we use for work or even games. The other problem is that every device produce special rays, which are really harmful for humans, because they may cause hazards diseases such as cancer. Moreover, it is because popular listen to music with earphones very loud, this may cause serious problems with ears and you might even became def. 
There are lots of ways how to solve this problem, but it wouldn't work if people isn't follow the rules. For example, to make your eyes stronger you should spend about 20 minutes on special exercises for eyes. You should also listen to music on a lower mode or without earphones. In case with rays, you should spend less time around such devices and spent more time walking with friends. 
In conclusion, I would like to say even if we are very close to devices such as mobile phones, computers, we should spend more time on the other activities, otherwise we will into robots.

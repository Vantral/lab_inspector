Nowadays there are some people who consider that countries should not import the food and develop their own production. Others believe that it is wrong opinion. So, who is right? I suppose that this discussion is really popular and widespread at present. In my opinion each government should help others with food and other facilities in terms of Globalisation. Firstly, there are no countries which can allow them to produce all kind of food: fruits, vegetables, meat and special types of food. It depends on their climate, finance, technological development and political situation. Secondly, if we do not help each other, the economical systems will suffer. The connection between different governments will disapear. Many developing countries will feel lack of important products and a lot of people will be ill. However, if we let us import and export food and products, we will stop the developing of our home production. It means that people choose foreign high-level products instead of "home-made". People, who believe that we should import as little as possible, lead the protection policy. It means that we should exchange foreign products on own-produced food. It is right position in some situations, but not nowadays. Globalization has a key role in our present life. We import and export not only a food, but also medical goods, people's help, clothes and others. Thus, it is a wrong way to produce the food that own population eats, because we live in one big world and we should help each other for each and common profit.

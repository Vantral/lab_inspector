In the following chart we can see a prediction of how sals of print and eBooks will change in the period of time from 2014 and 2018, in different countries. 
Looking at the chart, we notice that there are some crucial gaps between the amounts of books sold in stated USA, Germany, China and UK. The correlation of scales shows us some general tendencies, one of which being the rise of eBooks, the other one being consumption of books all in all. 
Looking at the chart more closely, it is obvious that USA sells more books than any of the other three countries listed. On the contrary, UK makes the smallest market of all four, followed closely by China. The other thing that catches our eye is that eBooks seem to become more popular if we believe the forecast for 2018. In USA and Germany the amount of eBooks rockets and multiplies by 1.5, in China the tendency the same, eBooks increase by 50%, in UK the uprising is not so radical, but it is still evident. 
To sum everything up, I can conclude that consumption of eBooks' production will increase, which will have a positive effect on markets in all four countries, especially USA.

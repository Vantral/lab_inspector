It is argued that free sharing and copy of music and films in the Internet does a lot of harm to the people who produce this content and those who enjoy it and those who do not want to pay must be considered as criminals. Personally I disagree with that claim and I hold the opinion that punishment is not an effective solution to the named problem. 
Undoubtely, there are some reasons for punishing people who do not pay for the content. To begin with, musicians and producers lose money they deserved and it leads to lack of motivation to create new films and music tracks. Additionally, money payed for art producers are investments in future projects. Finally, losing such amounts of money hurts not only creators, but also the government budget which has its own profit from the taxes. 
Nevertheless, punishing for copying and sharing music and videos seems to be bad idea. Firstly, free products of art provides cultural development of the population. It is irrational and even unfair to punish those who are aimed at self-development but do not have money for it. This person can be a child, a student or just somebody with financial problems. Secondly, people who are able to pay will pay if they adore the content and they want to say some thanks to those who created it. Thirdly, the Internet is the informational field which is difficult to control by the law, so punishing will be technically difficult to implement. 
To sum up, punishing for sharing and copying objects of art can satisfy those who produce them, but also can influence on cultural development in negative way.

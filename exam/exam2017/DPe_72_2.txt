Illegal pirate copies is a large problem of our life. Most of people don't want to pay for pleasures. The goverment and different producers try to solve this problem situation, but it is not too easy, because of big numbers of copies and large number of people, who use it. 
I agree with the statement, that copying and sharing, music or films on the internet is theft. First of all, to make firms or songs is a profession, and all work should be paid. Everyone get money from job, and producers also should get it. Although, it is not honest, when someone buy original discs or songs, for example, on app stor, when other people get it for free. Everyone should pay, not only a few per cent of users. Moreover, it is not right, when someone, who sells pirate copies get money from it. 
However, I don't agree with the statement, that people, who download these files should be punished. In my opinion, goverment should punish sellers, not users. Although, I believe, that it is necessary to give people opportunity to buy music and films easy and cheap. 
In the conclusion, I can say, that I'm sure, that goverment should explain people, that they have to pay for pleasure. When everyone understand it - ther won't be a problem.

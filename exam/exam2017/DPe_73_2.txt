Illigal downloading and copying is a crime. In my opinion, I think it is a big problem in media industy. 
If you want to create a great product, for example, film, you need to have producer, actors, director, plot and etc. This is a big job and it is also not free. People download films in the Internet because of that they do not go to cinemas for premieras. They prefer watch it in home, where they do not pay money for tickets. I agree that sharing the product should be punched. There is a huge illigal industry wich have money when sharing media product before official date of release because of views in the Net. There are groups in social media with illigal content having big audience, and they sharply rise. 
To sum up, illigal sharing and downloading never stop. People always want to watch new film or listen new music even it is a crime and

Nowadays, some people consider, that sportsmen should be banned for such a limited period, 2 years, for instance, if they cheat with drugs. Other people think that using of medicines for victory in competition is enough to ban athletes forever. On one hand, there were some accidents, when competitors used drugs and even knew about it. Sometimes the couch gives medicines to athlete in order to gift him/her an opportunity to be faster or stronger. Also sportsmen take some drugs because of their health statement. Some people take drugs because they are nervous and hate themself for this doings. That's why sometimes drug using can be explained. And for many people sport is the main carrier. On the other hand, we shouldn't forget that many athletes take the medicine with full understanding what they are doing. Bad men can be everywhere. In my way of thinking, there must be two steps verification. If the athlet is caught with drugs, he should be banned for two years in first time. If he is caught the second time, he should say good bye to his sportsman carrier. I consider, that everyone should have a second chance, but only once.

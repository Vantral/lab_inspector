There is opinion that countries shuld import food as little as possible and produce that their own population eats. And I diagre with that. 
First of all, not every country can produse food in his values. For example, Sealand, Japan and lots others ilands coutries. 
More over, It will be more effective if some big countries produse food. There is good word for it: specialization. It helps to use all resurses more effective. Secondly, specialization, needs cooperation and pice. It good for most of peoples, but not for agressors. agressors need to produce all that they need. Autorcia (produsing all products and materials, living without any import) have good sense of power, however all of tham quicly starts big wars or fals under attacts enimes, that want autercias forses. 
Now we have good worlds market, however if all countres use not trade, there isn't be this market too. It consists big problem: any cataclizm will be crutial: nobody can help, becouse he wants produse food for himself. but worlds cryzis overprodusing will not able witout traiding. Nevertheless in agrar countries it will be always.

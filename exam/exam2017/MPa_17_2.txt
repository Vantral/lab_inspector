The most controversial question nowadays is athletes using illegal drugs should be banned for a limeted period or for the rest of their lives. In this essay I goind to exemine the question from both of view and then give my own perspective on situation. People who think, that athletes cauught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally only for a limited period argued that one mistake must not to crash all life and carrier of man. Of course, they think, that it is illegal, but sometimes, for example, it could be the decision of trainer and not of athlets. Also, people who live only by competitions can lose everything, if they never can comeback to the sport. On other hand, after return man to sport who be banned for using drugs, the situation can happen again. And other people say, that it has no sence. It is only bring a problem for judge and other athletes. Also they argued that man can be caught after many years of using. He have a lot of regard getting by illegal way and it is important reason why he should be banned for the rest of his life. The both views have their own right arguments and can be exist. However, in my opinion ban for the rest of live is too hard punishment for all athletes. At the same time it can be used to people who was caught by using a few times and already had the light punishment. For people, who was caught by using illegar drugs at the first time, I think, need to use ban for a limited period.

The topic of food import is discussed by many experts nowadays. This question touches many aspects of life such as health, economy and culture. I strongly believe that countries should produse products for the global market and should import food. I have some arguments to prove my point of view. To start with, we live in the globalized world where people travel to different countries regularly. THis process is unavoidable. There are many cases when people come to a country and realize they cannot eat local food as they get stomach aches from it. To avoid this, countries should have some imported food so travelers could find something that they can eat. Secondly, it is known that humans need a veriety of vitamins contained in their meals to stay healthy, Sometimes, because of the climate countries are not able to grow all the food that a mans' organism needs. In this case imported goods can help create healthy diet. Last but not least, importing food leads to a wide range of choise so natives can buy whatever they want. Creating a huge choice with the help of international trade is assential in order to have a prosperious economy. A good proof for this argument are economies of European countries and economy of the USA. To sum up, even though some people believe that countries should not participate in international food market and should produce all the food themselves, I think that evidence in support of import and global trade is much stronger.

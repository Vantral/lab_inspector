Some part of humanity thinks that countries should import to other countries a minimum part of food which produces in this country, And the food should be the same value with food which population needs. I am disagree with this statement and I will try to explain why. 
First of all, there are some countries in the world which cannot produce as much food as it is population needs. SO other countries can help such countries and it's people to survive by import some food to them. Also some countries have not got a special aquipment for producing any type of doof or in this region some species of plants cannot grow or kind of anymals cannot live. But this countryes can produce other type of resources. So countries can excnenge thir goods, or sell some products, with they have to earn money and buy food or something else from another country. Secondly, if country can produce more food than it's population can eat, souch country will be able to sell a part of food which they don't need to earn some money and improve the live of population of this country or it can solve some problems which this county has (for example problems with bad roads). 
In conclusion, I can say that it is really necessary for all of us and for all countries to help each other with food. That is why countries, which can produce more food than they need, should do that and give or sell this food to other countries.

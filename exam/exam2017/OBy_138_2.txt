There is an opinion between some people that it is no need to produce food for import and that countries should only feed their own citizens. This issue is very complicated and advantages and disadvantages should be discussed. 
It seems to me that lower the import as much as possible is not very good idea in case of several reasons. 
Firstly, the country could lose profit from some special sorts of plants or rare animals which could live only on it's territory. Importing specific sorts of plants, for example, pineapples from Mexico or Brazil, would give them money to country development and also import gives an opportunity for foreigners to try something new The last reason is that selling food to other countries would make the financial and political relationships stronger if the leader of the country would prefer to import nothing. 
Anyway, the counteropinion exists and the arguments are also interesting. Some people might say that food import is a evil because in developing countries the economics is not strong enough to sell goods such as food, There may be nothing left for citizens of this country, what may cause the sufferings of people, demonstrations and blooms of violence and aggression, One more reason is that in some concrete situations country could not have an opportunity to sell it's products anywhere abroad, so it will not be helpful at any way to improve a financial situation. 
To conclude with, importing food is very important topic in economical programms of many countries. If an import would not exist we possible may not try so much dishes and would not met the other cultures.

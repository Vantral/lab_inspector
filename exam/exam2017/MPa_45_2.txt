Nowadays, international business of food achieve the higher level. People prefer exchange not only information, but other products and services. Despite the fact that some people think that all countries should produce only own food, I believe that it is very necessary to import product, if it is possible. Firstly, the quality and amount of food depend on weather. If some country have global problems with drougths, people will not to produce some of product, such as vegetables and fruits. Thus, international communication can helps this countries to find products, they will be restrict in choice of food. Secondly, some people cannot to have adility to travel around the world. If all countries will produce only own population eats, citizinees of each town won't have ability to eat difference food. For example, a lot of fruits produce in Asia. As we know, this products can help people around the world improve their helth. Thus, if countries will not aim to import fruits, children and adults cannot get enough amount of important vitamins. Thirdly, import of food can help countries improve their economy. They have ability to produce the highest quality food not only for themself, but import as much as possible in different countries. Theirs revenue will rise, thus they can use money in different spheres for developing state. To sum up, countries should exchange food products owing to it helps not only only minority what countries eats different kind of food, but this way can will rise this economic indexes.

In the modern world trade between countries is very deveped. And it is very important to support world conection and trade. But many people think that it is not nessesary to import products from others countries, they think that nations can produce enough food and another stuff for their country. However, it is unbelievable. More and more clever people understang that without world trade it will be difficult to develop native economy and economy of the world. Every country have advantages and disadvantages in producing food products. Because of climat or teritory. For example, In Russia we have a lot of fields with row, we have a huge teritories for field and can take a lot of row for our population and for that populations who have no territory for big fields as Japan or Chili. Moreover, in Turkey grows lemons, oranges and other tropical fruits but is northern regions like Finland or Great Britain climat don't allow to grow them. There are examples not only for people can eat any products that they like, that can't be produce in their country. Furthermore, world trade is a great facility to improve economy due to countries can buy products for less price that thay need to produce them. And also countries that don't spend a lot of sourses for producing food can sell it and get extra money. In conclusion I want to say that we couldn't to awoid world traid because it's bring a huge benefit for economies of all countries and for every person in the world.

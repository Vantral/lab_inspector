Lie is everywhere nowadays: in politics, TV and Internet, newespapers and magazines. And Also in sport. Some people want to be the best without lots of trainings and work on themselves. To make their dream real they use illegal drugs. But people who are in sport are really clever and made some doping tests to show persones, using diffirent illegal medicaments. Of course, there are many athlets that were banned for using drugs. But one of the biggest problem is how long they should be banned. Some people think that such athletes should be banned for a limited period. This sportsmens for this period will lose their form, sponsors and became less famouse. They will understand that illegal drugs is incorrect way to succes and won't be lie to the world in the future. Another people think that such athletes should be banned from competing for the rest of their lives. This people think sportsmens won't understand their mistakes and continue to find ways to make results better without training and working. Personally, I don't like the idea of life long ban. Most of athletes, banned for the first time, will understand how serious was their mistake. So there are will be no such situations with them in future. But if this athletes cought with illegal drugs one more time, I agree with Idea of lifelong ban in this situation. It is unreal to be the best if you lie to the world. And every legendary sportsmen understad this idea. Problem with drugs may be the one of the biggest in sport but medics don't help any one to become a legend.

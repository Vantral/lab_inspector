Infact, that majority of countries around the world have own production of food, services and other important goods for life. However, some people think that countries only need to produce the food for own population and not for import in other countries. I strongly disagree with this point of view. First of all, import of foods and other goods lead to globalization, that is very useful for world's population and conection among different countries and their governments. For example, people start to communicate with other people, figure out new cultures, tradition and laws. Also, people can try some exotic foods like mango, which are not produced in their country. Second, import is very good for economy of country. Country can sell some unusual products for other countries in high prices. So, importing country can have significant profit from this "Busines". In addition to globalization, people can have more willing to travel in this countries. They can want trying some food without transportation. What's also good for economy of country. It is increase inbound tourism in this area of the country, where produce some exotic importing goods and foods. However, there is some point of view that countries should aim to import as little as possible, because production should have a high quantaty of foods. It will not possible, if the main purpose of production is importing. That is why the goverment of country should think only about their own population and health. To sum up, I think that import of foods is own choice of every country. They should select succesful and effective plan for development of country for happy future of their population

Some people believe that countis should import food as little as possible and aim for food wich was produced in their country for their own population eats. I agree with this statement and I'd like to give some arguments for it. 
At first, if country produce food by yourselves, she have food independence from other countries. So, if one country would be need to cut relations with another country, it will be to easier, becous other country cann't have impact for us.

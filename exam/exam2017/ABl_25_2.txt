Internet pirates and tourent-trachers is one of the most problems for film and musicians producers, studious and labels. However, torrents it's a good opportunity for poor people watching new films and listening beautiful music. 
On the one hand, a lot of people with a good deal think that tuaking it is theft because music lables, game developers and film's studios less a big part of benefit. Without these money, this companiy can't make a quality new products. A good example is a "Metro Golden Mayer" which loss more than 3,5 billions dollars from 2008 year. The biggest project of company films about agent 007 James Bond hasn't enough money for making them, and new films of this franshise made only once in 6-7 years versus once in 2-3 years in 1990-08. 
On the other hand a lot of people think that opportunity of free watching gaming or listening it a good chance not only for consumers but and for actors, artist and companyes. Yes, of course they are missing their money, but they are get fame and respect from million people which can't spend 20-30 $ on film or 50-60$ for game. What is more, many people which download torren files and get pleasure from them will buy not only licensed driver this product but and next product of this firm. For example "Witcher 3" from "CD-Project" had the biggest sellers after 2 month of release, maybe it will effect of "white pirates" which buy this game after one-two month of gaming on pirate copies. 
In conclusion I want say that this problem is very difficult for once meaning. I hope that political of cost makeup will more and more loyal and all people will have opportunity use only licensed product on official copies and this solution will good for both hand of this discussion.

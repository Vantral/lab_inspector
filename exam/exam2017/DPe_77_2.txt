It's a well-known that musicians and producers have a lot of money from illegal pirete copies. Someone think that people who copying and downald files on the Internet should be punished, but I think that it's not really good solution of problem. 
Firstly, many musicans and film producers and etc. bocome popular because their music and films can be seeing free in the Internet. In our time Internet the most popular place where we spend out time and make different things like watching film and listening musics Furthermore, not all people can buy the original disc with music and films, when in the websites there are free versions. 
In conclusion, I want to say that I disagree with given opinion that people who sharing the files with music and films in the Internet should be punished. I think that It is normal in our times

In Yakutsk average temperature changes strongly during year. Starting from January it grows from min -42 till max +25 in July. +25 is the highest average temperature in Yakutsk. Then temperature falls from +25 to -40 in December. We can see that the lowest temperature is acheived in January (-42). Therefore, the diagram of average temperature in Yakutsk is n-shaped and we can see an ascent from January to July and then we can see a descent. The Amplitude is big and it is approximately 25-(-42)=67 degrees. 
In Rio the amplitude is much smaller. The highest possible temperature is acheived in January (+30) and the louest at July (18). Therefore, the Amplitude for Rio is 30-18=12 degrees - It is 6.5 times lower than in Yakutsk. Moreover, we can see that the shapes of diagrams are different. In Rio average temperature dedlines from January till July, so it is u-shaped, what is vice versa in Yakutsk. 
Such a big difference in amplitude of diagrams can be explained by different climate types. Yakutsk is placed in the harshly continental climate zone while Rio is in the tropical one. Rio is on the South semisphere of Earth while Yakutsk is on the worth one. It explains why the shape of curves are different: Yakutsk's winter is from December till January while Rio is one from June till August.

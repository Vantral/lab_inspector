The graphs below show the average maximum and minimum temperatures in Yakutsk, Russia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
To start off, the temperatures in Yakutsk fluctuate nearly throughout the year, ranging from +25*C in the summer months to around -40*C in December-January. This is not the case for Rio de Janeiro, where temperatures are a lot more stable throughout, with the minimum being around +17*C in the summer to the maximum of +29-30*C in the winter. 
Of course, the most obvious observation is that Rio de Janeiro is much warmer than Yakutsk, the temperature does not go below +15*C, which is not true for Yakutsk. 
In both cities the maximum and the minimum temperatures in the same months do not differ very much. The average delta in Rio is around 8-12*C, while in Yakutsk it is around 12-13*C. There are, of course, exceptions. For example, in March in Yakutsk the minimum and maximum temperatures can differ for as much as 18*C.

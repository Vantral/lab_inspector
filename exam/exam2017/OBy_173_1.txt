The graph below shows information about trade among countries of Eastern Europe. First chart shows shares of goods transported by rail, while second graph give information about road transportation. 
Firstly, it can be seen, that manufactured goods have similar shares in rail and road transportation. Additionally, chemicals have approximately same shares with 11% in railway transported and 16% in the toad. The difference that strikes in my eyes is that the biggest share in goods transported by rail is taken by metals with 35%. On the other hand, it is only 11% in the road transportation. The delivery of food products takes 30% share, when it is significantly less in train transportation with just 11%. 
In conclusion, the general trend is that heavy goods, like machinery and metals, are transported by rail, while food is mainly delivered by road.

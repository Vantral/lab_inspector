In our modern world there is a strong beleife that each country should specialize only on that very product that their own population consume and eats. That is why governments policy should reduce import food from the abroad. I defenetly disagree with this position for several of reasons. First of all, it goes without saying that climate conditions cannot allow people from different countries consume all nescessary products for maintaining good health and successful daily life. It is very significant to eat products, containing various vitamins to support a good form of organisms. Moreover, in terms of globalization, new approach in economic specialization has appeared. Neoliberalism developed modern understanding of effective international producing, where each country plays its own role in the world market. Every state produces the food that demands less costs for this particular country in compersion with others and provide this product for the world market. It is also well-known, that goverments that concentrate on import are successful in their economy, such as developed German. Besides, it would not be an exaggeration to say that world economy is deeply connected with internal economic situation of each country. Therefore, the decission to reduce import may dramatically influence the situation in the whole world. For example, it consequently may lead to breaking out of crisis or collapees in Monetary Fund. Taking everything into consideration, leading an effective export-import policy is very important not only for people in world community, but also for the well-organized economy. Every country and its own product take indispensible place in the world trade structure. That is why, personally I consider that states should not aim to reduce import.

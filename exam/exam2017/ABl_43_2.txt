N. Information technologies like Internet provide us diverse entertaiments. We have access to films, listen to the same kind of music. It has resulted in losing money for musicians and film producers. Some experts tend to think that people, who download these files must be punished I disagree with this statement. 
On the one hand, the intellectual property should be secured like other kinds of private property the desire of getting money for their work is absolutely moral. But the objects of intellectual creativity has one feature, which differ it from material valuables. It is endless using. You can make enormous number copies of your worn And earn money permanently. I tend to believe that it isn't justice. To my point of view it can be rational to establish indiciary term when copying or sharing object of intellectual property is illegal but after completing of this period copying must be legal. 
I agree that the break of copyright is crime. But I tend to feel that punishment for users is very cruel idea. All people has little weaknesses and vices. We can compare this situation with situation in struggle against drugs. In many countries the government punish only drug dealers not drug users. I think this way is relevant in situation with intellectual property. We must punish people who copy and share films and music not consumers. 
In conclusion, I want to tell that ideal solution of intellectual property issue must concern on establishing term when people mustn't copying and sharing films and music and punishment for pirates not clients.

It is sometimes claimed that food production of all countries should be focused on the local markets only, and that countries should not import much food. In this very essay I will discuss the statement and give my own thoughts on the topic. To begin with, such an idea has known for centuries as protectionism. This method of economy regulation is aimed to "protect" local businesses from the unwanted competition with international companies. Proceeding to the food market, it is necessary to mention that food security is a thing of vital importance for any country as it keeps labor forces productive, and, as a result, makes the economy healthier. Furthermore, governments are interested in developing independent economies that cannot be manipulated by competitors behind the borders. A great example of perfectly used protectionism policies is USA. United States government has been using the border control with Mexico since early 20th century, not allowing them to import vegetables and fruits so that the local producers prospere. However, it is not always possible for a country to secure stable food supply for their citizens. As an example, russian producers just not able to create some industry that will allow us to have a stable supply of some fruits here due to european climate, so it is a smart manouver to import only the things your country cannot produce. All in all, I can say that I do agree with the statement. History evidence that most of the countries that have implied protectionism policies have become more succesful in building strong and competitive economies that dominate the global market. However, having known the fact that there is need for food, it is better to sacrifice some spare sovereignty and let others sell theirs goods in your country, because the citizens must not be hungry.

The chart gives the information about the unemployment rate in five word regions in two years: 2014 and 2015. 
The highest unemployment rate was fixed in N. Africa while the lowest was in S. Asia. However, these two regions have simmilarity as the percent of unemployment rate did not change and stayed 12,5% for N. Africa and 3,9% for S. Asia. There were changes for three others regions. For Middle East the percent decreased from 11% to 9,6% and for Latin America it went down for 1% from 6,8% to 5,8%. Speaking about EU, the unemployment rate in this region increased for 0,4% from 7,5% to 7,9%. As we can see, there is evidence that for two regions the percent of unemployment rate was stable for two years while for three others it was fluctuating. 
To sum up, the worldwide tendency also stayed the same as the percent for 2014 and 2015 was 5,9%.

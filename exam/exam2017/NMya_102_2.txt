In our age, more and more people are becoming worried as advancing technology changes the way we live and thus, possibly, causes health issues. 
In my opinion, there are indeed quite a range of specific health problems that spring from our sometimes malformed modern lifestyle. As such, we suffer from heart diseases a lot more than our ancestors because of increased level of everyday stress and lack of physical activities; we are at risk of various kinds of cancer due to bad ecological conditions: obesity becomes widespread, since our nutrition culture is far from healthy: and so on. 
Despite what has been said, there are ways to reduce, if not get rid of, such problems. We need to remember that not the technologies themselves are to blame, but rather our own ignorance and laziness. Modern city life is indeed stressful, however, advanced urban planning technologies allow us to reduce noise levels, traffic jams, and improve air condition. Industry does cause significant damage to the environment, but it is with more advanced technology that we create environmental-friendly production processes and use clean energy sources. In the end, without technological progress there would have been no modern medicine, which allowed developed countries to increase mean lifespawn more than twofold since XIX century. 
As our society is developing alongside with technologies we use, it becomes more obvious that the progress is not to be feared. Each new generation becomes more educated than its precessors, and all of those bizarre myths, such as that microvave radiation leads to cancer or LD-monitors are especially bad for our sight, go away. I personally believe that further technological advance is the only way for humanity to overcome the global problems the world is facing nowadays, even if some of them originated from use of less complicated technology.

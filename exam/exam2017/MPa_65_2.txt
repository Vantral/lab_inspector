There is no doubt that food self-suficiency of countries has become burning issue due to world-wide impact of globalization. Some people consider that produced food should mostly be provided on population needs rather than feed public with foreign one. In following essay I will convince both sides of question and argue my own opinion towards it. From one point of views, food supplies that cover all needs of society is beneficial, because country will not suffer from this kind of dependence from food-providing countries. Thus, there will not be pressure to make food import agreements as government devides self-grown and produced meals. Moreover, this solution gives great ability to control all shift of food production and obviously its quality. Nevertheless, there are another side of issue. Food self-suficiency can lead to partly isolation of country from world trade, so therefore world market as it involves wide range of industries. Furthermore, some countries have not capability of supplying food to whole nation due to lack of resources, land, techniques or vehicles. For my own believe, country should find golden middle in stated issue depending on its geographical and trading features. For instance, Japan inspite of island location is one of the most developed countries not only in food industry. To sum up, it is strongly considered that whether country should spend only self food resourses on needs of its people, there is quite beneficial possibility to import some part from outside if its production costs too much in comparison with buying.

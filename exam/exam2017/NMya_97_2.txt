It is widely believed that countries should product as much food as their population needs and shouldn't concentrate on the import. To my mind, countries have to produce enough for their own population as well as for selling it abroad. It will defenetely improve economic situation in the country. 
First of all, in the modern life a lot of developed countries achieve the stable economic situation by selling produced food to other countries. It must be admitted that the quality of all spheres in our life depend on the country's economic situation. 
Nowadays a lot of countries in the world can still be proud of their independence because of their export. For instance, countries like Peru and Venesuela are well-known by their fruits export to other countries. And it significantly benefits they economy. 
Secondly, some countries are not able to produce enough food for their own population due to climate issues. Thus, countries like Russia and Canada have to buy import food from southern countries. To remain their economic situation stable these countries sell other goods like oil, wood etc. 
It must be said that people who believe that countries should concentrate only on producing food for their own population think that it will make their life much easier. They will have to work less because they would produce food only for themselves. 
To sum up, I am defenitely disagree with the given people opinion. I think, that import and export are crucial parts in countries economic. If the goverment wants to provide to their own population stable lifes they should not forget about import and export.

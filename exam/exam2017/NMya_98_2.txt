Many countries in the world have financial problems linked to export and import questions. Some of opinions claims that country must produce food for the wrong population and don't buy nothing from other countries I agree, that it is good idea to be independent from other countries, how it's be nowadays, when, for example, Russia closes all ways for import from Europe. Independense will grow countries economicy, because money wasted by population for food doesn't "floight away" from country and with that indepensity import will grow. 
People will be protected from DNA-modified products, there will be much more working places for unemployments. Never append the situation, when people can't find some needed kinds of products, because "Yesterday at boundary was stopped illegal transport with potatoes". County will have much more power in control of food production, price can be regulated, produce plan can be modified. All factors will be better when countries will produce the food only for their populatio and there is no bad in wide aspect of this change.

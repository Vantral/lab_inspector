Nowadays, most countries exchange products they produce. However, some people think that countries should produce food only for its own citizens and minimize its imports. 
In this essay I would like to discuss this point of view. 
People who support this idea claim that, first of all, their country should not depend on other countries' supply in such an important category as food. Food is vital for citizens and if some problems occur in the world market such as prohibition of export to the country due to, for example, political issues or sudden increase of market prices so that the country cannot afford to buy food from overseas the citizens will suffer. That is why the country should try to produce as much needed food as possible and import as little as possible. 
However, there are several problems with fully domestic food supply. The main arguement is that different countries have different climate conditions and geographic features. For example, it is almost impossible to grow cocoa beans in Scotland or bananas in Canada. Although a lot of suitable technologies exist these days, their cost is still too high. 
This brings another arguement which is also about the cost. Countries have been developing their own food specializations for centuries and recreation of domestic markets can be really expensive and, which is more crutial, inefficient. For example, successful cheese componies cannot be established in 10 years in countries with no experience in cheese making due to lack of technologies and specialists. 
That is why, in my opinion, countries should develop sectors they already specialize in. At the same time, some step-by-step measures should be taken to develop other sectors so that any sudden changes in the world market would not effect its citizens that much. So it is important to develop a food market strategy suitable to your own country.

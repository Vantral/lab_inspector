Many of us says, that their country should produce all for each men or women, who live on this territory. These people believe, that food import government should use as little as possible. Ideal country for these people it are may cities and manufactories, when developing each product of our everyday ration for breakfast and dinner. In this essay talk about both sides of this topic. 
Of course, situation when people eat products that produced on own plantations is good for the costs of this items. People do not pay more, because in this situation costa not include pay for delivery and many other taxs. Moreover, live without import products helps people in these countries be a sure in next day. Of course, these factors says, that this model good for all countries in the world. 
However, many countries do not have some resources on their territory. For example, many countries do not have oil or gas. But many of these countries have rice, salt, sugar, vegetables or other products. It is the basis of international economic. If countries will not change resources, then life each of us will be bad and worry. Because process of change resources is one of the most important for each government. 
I think, that our everyday life now is better then life in country without good economic structure. Of course, it is good, when all of your ration growing on your garden, but my opinion is in modern world it is not possible. I think, that each country should use as own products as import resources.
